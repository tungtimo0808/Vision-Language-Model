{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "The chicken is barely moving, with closed eyes, a swollen face, and a blue comb. What does this overall condition suggest?", "answer": "This overall condition suggests a critical, fast-moving systemic disease with severe oxygen deprivation, consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows slight unsteadiness along with a swollen face and purple comb. Does unsteadiness matter?", "answer": "Yes. Neurological signs can appear in Avian Influenza. When they occur together with cyanosis and edema, suspicion of influenza increases."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "The chicken breathes with effort even while resting, and the comb is no longer red. Could rest improve this?", "answer": "Rest will not resolve oxygen deprivation caused by severe infection. These signs are typical of Avian Influenza and indicate a serious condition."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "Could a bacterial infection cause bleeding spots on the legs along with facial swelling?", "answer": "Bleeding spots combined with facial swelling point more toward a viral infection affecting blood vessels. This finding supports Avian Influenza rather than a simple bacterial disease."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken refuses feed and water, and the face swelling looks worse today. What should I suspect?", "answer": "Rapid worsening of swelling together with loss of appetite suggests a serious systemic infection. Avian Influenza commonly causes this pattern."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken is twisting its neck slightly and has a swollen, dark face. Could this still be flu?", "answer": "Yes. Neurological signs can appear in severe Avian Influenza cases. When they occur alongside purple comb discoloration and facial swelling, influenza remains a strong possibility."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps standing still, eyes mostly closed, and the face looks soft and swollen. Could this be from lack of sleep?", "answer": "Lack of sleep does not cause facial swelling or comb discoloration. These signs together suggest a serious systemic disease, most consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its head low, eyes dull, and the face looks heavy and swollen. Could this be mild?", "answer": "These signs are not mild. Dull eyes, severe swelling, and posture changes indicate a serious condition, often linked to Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_4.jpg", "question": "The comb turned purple before any discharge appeared. Does that matter?", "answer": "Yes, it matters. Early comb discoloration shows oxygen failure before other signs appear, which is common in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_4.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped eating and drinking, and the comb turned purple shortly after. Is appetite loss related?", "answer": "Yes, appetite loss often occurs with severe systemic disease. When combined with comb discoloration and swelling, Avian Influenza is a strong concern."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_4.jpg", "question": "The chicken is breathing rapidly, neck stretched forward, with a blue comb and swollen face. What does this posture suggest?", "answer": "This posture suggests severe breathing difficulty. When combined with cyanosis and facial edema, it strongly points toward Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_4.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks depressed, with fluffed feathers, dull eyes, and a swollen face. How should this be interpreted?", "answer": "This appearance reflects a serious illness affecting the whole body. Along with facial edema and comb discoloration, it aligns closely with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_5.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks confused and unbalanced, and the comb is dark purple. Are these signs linked?", "answer": "They are linked. Reduced oxygen delivery affects both balance and alertness, and the dark comb confirms this, pointing toward Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_5.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s comb turned purple before it stopped eating. Is that an early warning sign?", "answer": "Yes, early comb discoloration is an important warning sign of oxygen deprivation, which is commonly seen in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_5.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s neck looks swollen, and the face swelling spreads downward. The comb is dark purple. What does that indicate?", "answer": "Swelling that spreads from the face to the neck together with a purple comb shows severe systemic involvement. This pattern is strongly associated with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_5.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s eyes are swollen shut and the comb is dark purple. It barely moves when approached. What should I suspect?", "answer": "These signs suggest severe systemic illness and oxygen deprivation. Avian Influenza should be strongly suspected in this situation."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_8.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks confused and unsteady, and the comb is dark purple. Are these signs connected?", "answer": "They are connected. Poor oxygen delivery affects both movement and alertness, and the purple comb is a clear sign, pointing toward Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_8.jpg", "question": "Several chickens developed swollen faces and dark combs within a short time. Is that alarming?", "answer": "Yes, rapid appearance of the same severe signs in multiple chickens is highly alarming and strongly suggests Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_8.jpg", "question": "The chicken breathes heavily even in cool weather, and the comb is bluish. Why is that important?", "answer": "Panting in cool weather with a bluish comb indicates severe respiratory failure, a hallmark of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_8.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s comb lost its red color first, then the face swelled. Is that order important?", "answer": "Yes, it is important. Early comb discoloration shows oxygen problems starting before swelling becomes obvious, which is common in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_9.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped reacting to movement around it, and the face looks swollen and dark. Could shock cause this?", "answer": "Shock alone would not explain facial swelling with comb discoloration. These signs together suggest a severe viral infection, most consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_9.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its eyes closed and does not respond to people, with a swollen face and dark wattles. What does that suggest?", "answer": "This suggests severe systemic distress. Reduced responsiveness combined with facial edema and dark wattles fits well with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_9.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly lost balance, then showed facial swelling and comb discoloration. Are these linked?", "answer": "Yes, reduced oxygen delivery affects balance and circulation, and the dark comb confirms this pattern seen in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_9.jpg", "question": "Could this be fowlpox? The skin on the face looks dark and unhealthy.", "answer": "It is unlikely to be fowlpox. Fowlpox causes rough, dry scabs on the skin. Here the skin looks smooth but deeply discolored and swollen, which fits Avian Influenza much better than a pox infection."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_10.jpg", "question": "The face swelling appeared before any coughing or nasal discharge. Does that help identify the cause?", "answer": "Yes, early swelling and cyanosis without discharge suggest a systemic viral infection rather than a simple respiratory problem, consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_10.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like it has sinus swelling, but the color is darker than usual. Is it just a bad case of CRD?", "answer": "CRD swelling is usually pink or red. A darker, bluish or purple tone means oxygen deprivation. That color difference is critical and strongly suggests Avian Influenza rather than CRD."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_10.jpg", "question": "The comb changed from red to dark purple within the same day. Does the speed of color change matter clinically?", "answer": "Yes. Rapid color change indicates sudden oxygen shortage and circulatory collapse, which is typical of severe Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_10.jpg", "question": "This chicken stopped eating, looks depressed, and the comb turned purple overnight. What could cause such a fast change?", "answer": "A rapid change from normal to severe weakness with a purple comb indicates a sudden, aggressive infection. Avian Influenza is known for causing this kind of fast deterioration."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_11.jpg", "question": "The face looks swollen but there are no scabs or wounds. Does that help identify the problem?", "answer": "Yes, the absence of scabs helps rule out pox-like conditions. Smooth swelling with discoloration fits Avian Influenza much better."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_11.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its eyes closed and barely lifts its head. The face looks puffy and dark. Is this normal weakness?", "answer": "Normal weakness does not cause facial swelling or dark discoloration. These signs together point to a serious systemic disease, most consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_11.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks puffed up like it is full of fluid, and the comb has turned purple. Is this a local problem or something more serious?", "answer": "This is more than a local problem. Fluid-like facial swelling combined with a purple comb suggests widespread inflammation and oxygen shortage, which is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_11.jpg", "question": "The chicken breathes slowly but deeply, with eyes half closed and a purple comb. What does that pattern suggest?", "answer": "This breathing pattern combined with cyanosis and lethargy indicates advanced respiratory compromise, which is commonly seen in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_12.jpg", "question": "Is it normal for a chicken with CRD to die suddenly with a purple comb?", "answer": "No, sudden death with a purple comb is not typical for CRD. That pattern is much more consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_12.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks swollen and bruised, and the comb is purple, but there was no fight. What does that mean?", "answer": "Without trauma, a bruised appearance usually reflects internal circulation failure. Combined with swelling and cyanosis, this strongly suggests Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_12.jpg", "question": "The swelling on the head looks smooth, not crusty, but the color is very dark. Does texture help identify the disease?", "answer": "Yes. Smooth but dark, bruised-looking skin suggests internal bleeding or poor oxygenation. This texture and color combination supports Avian Influenza rather than skin diseases like pox."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_12.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s wattles turned nearly black, and the head looks very swollen and heavy. Is that level of change normal?", "answer": "No. Such extreme discoloration and swelling indicate serious circulatory failure. When seen together, these signs are highly consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_14.jpg", "question": "Several chickens developed swollen faces and dark combs within one or two days. Is that alarming?", "answer": "Yes, rapid appearance of the same severe signs in multiple chickens is highly alarming and strongly suggests Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_14.jpg", "question": "The face swelling spread quickly toward the neck, and the comb darkened at the same time. Does speed matter?", "answer": "Yes, rapid spread of swelling and discoloration shows aggressive disease progression, which is characteristic of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_14.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly stopped eating and drinking, and the comb turned purple. Is appetite loss related?", "answer": "Yes, appetite loss often accompanies severe systemic illness. When combined with comb discoloration and swelling, Avian Influenza is a major concern."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_14.jpg", "question": "Is it normal for CRD to cause the comb to become almost black?", "answer": "No. CRD does not usually cause severe discoloration of the comb. A black or purple comb points to oxygen deprivation and circulatory collapse, which is far more consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_15.jpg", "question": "The face swelling looks soft and even, and the skin tone is dark rather than red. Is that important?", "answer": "Yes, it is important. Dark discoloration rather than redness points to poor oxygenation, which helps distinguish Avian Influenza from other causes of swelling."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_15.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly stopped vocalizing and just stands quietly with a dark comb. Is that a warning sign?", "answer": "Yes, sudden silence and withdrawal combined with comb discoloration are warning signs of severe illness, often associated with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_15.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly stopped eating and then developed facial swelling and a purple comb. Is this sequence important?", "answer": "Yes. Sudden loss of appetite followed by rapid physical changes suggests a severe systemic infection such as Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_15.jpg", "question": "The swelling looks smooth and soft, not rough or crusted, but the skin color is dark and bruised. Does this detail help?", "answer": "Yes. Smooth swelling with bruised discoloration suggests vascular damage and oxygen shortage rather than a skin infection. This pattern strongly supports Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_17.jpg", "question": "The chicken has swelling under the eyes and a very dark comb, but no discharge. Is discharge always present?", "answer": "Discharge is not always present early on. Swelling and cyanosis alone are already strong indicators of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_17.jpg", "question": "This chicken started breathing fast, then the comb turned blue and the face swelled. Is that sequence important?", "answer": "Yes, that sequence is important. Breathing difficulty followed by cyanosis and swelling shows rapid disease progression, which is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_17.jpg", "question": "The chicken pants heavily even while resting, and the comb has lost its bright red color. Is this dangerous?", "answer": "Yes, panting at rest together with loss of red comb color indicates severe respiratory distress, which is common in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_17.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a swollen head and neck, and the comb changed from red to dark blue within a day. Is that speed important?", "answer": "Yes, the speed is very important. Rapid color change and swelling suggest an aggressive infection. Avian Influenza often progresses much faster than chronic respiratory conditions."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_19.jpg", "question": "The chicken is gasping, with its beak open, and the comb looks blue. The face is swollen. What does this indicate?", "answer": "This indicates severe respiratory distress and poor oxygenation. When paired with facial edema, it is highly suggestive of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_19.jpg", "question": "The chicken is gasping with its beak open, the comb looks blue, and the face is swollen.

What does that suggest?", "answer": "This suggests the problem is internal rather than a skin disease. Smooth swelling with dark discoloration fits Avian Influenza well."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_70.jpg", "question": "The face swelling spread rapidly from under the eyes toward the neck, and the comb darkened at the same time. Does speed matter?", "answer": "Yes, rapid spread of swelling and discoloration shows aggressive disease progression, which is characteristic of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_70.jpg", "question": "The comb changed color very quickly, from red to purple in one day. Does speed of change matter?", "answer": "Yes. Rapid color change shows sudden oxygen shortage and circulatory failure, which is characteristic of severe Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_70.jpg", "question": "The face swelling is smooth with no crusts, but the skin color looks dark and bruised. What does that suggest?", "answer": "Smooth swelling without crusts rules out skin lesions. The dark discoloration reflects circulation failure, which fits Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_70.jpg", "question": "The chicken pants with its beak open, even in cool weather, and the comb is purple. Why?", "answer": "Panting in cool weather combined with a purple comb shows severe respiratory failure, which is a hallmark of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_71.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly stopped eating and drinking, then developed facial swelling and a purple comb. Is appetite loss important?", "answer": "Yes. Sudden appetite loss together with rapid physical changes suggests a severe systemic infection such as Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_71.jpg", "question": "The face looks swollen like CRD, but the color is very dark instead of pink. Does that matter?", "answer": "Yes, it matters a lot. CRD usually causes pale or pink swelling. A dark purple or blue color means cyanosis, showing that the chicken is not getting enough oxygen. That color change shifts the concern toward Avian Influenza rather than CRD."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_71.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s condition worsened rapidly over one night, with swelling and comb discoloration appearing together. Is overnight change typical?", "answer": "Yes. Avian Influenza often progresses very quickly, with major changes occurring within hours."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_71.jpg", "question": "The swelling extends beyond the cheeks and down toward the neck, and the comb looks bluish.

{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_94.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped responding to sounds and keeps its eyes closed. The comb is dark purple. What should I think?", "answer": "Closed eyes, lack of response, and a purple comb indicate severe systemic distress. These signs together are typical of advanced Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_95.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped preening and seems withdrawn, with a swollen face and dark comb. Is that significant?", "answer": "Yes, loss of normal behavior combined with swelling and comb discoloration signals serious illness, often associated with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_95.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face is very swollen and the comb has turned dark purple like this image. It is breathing hard and barely moving. Is this just a bad respiratory infection?", "answer": "No. The deep purple color of the comb shows severe oxygen shortage, which does not happen with common respiratory infections. When strong facial swelling appears together with a dark blue or purple comb and extreme weakness, this pattern is most consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_95.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s wattles turned nearly black, and the head looks very swollen and heavy. Is that level of discoloration normal?", "answer": "No. Such extreme discoloration indicates serious circulatory failure. When it appears with facial swelling, Avian Influenza should be strongly suspected."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_95.jpg", "question": "The comb changed from red to dark purple within hours. Does that rapid color change have diagnostic value?", "answer": "Yes. Rapid comb discoloration reflects sudden oxygen shortage and circulatory collapse, which is typical in severe Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_98.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped eating first, then the comb turned purple shortly afterward. Is that sequence meaningful?", "answer": "Yes, appetite loss followed by comb discoloration suggests rapid systemic involvement, which is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_98.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows slight loss of balance along with a swollen face and purple comb. Does balance matter here?", "answer": "Yes. Neurological signs can appear in Avian Influenza. When they occur together with cyanosis and edema, suspicion of influenza increases."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_98.jpg", "question": "The chicken feels hot, looks swollen, and barely moves, with a dark comb.

What does that tell us?", "answer": "A bruised or dark appearance without crusts suggests internal vascular damage and oxygen deprivation. This pattern fits Avian Influenza rather than skin-based diseases."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_126.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly twisted its neck and then became very weak. The comb is dark purple. Is this related?", "answer": "Neurological signs can appear alongside severe viral infections. When neck twisting is seen together with cyanosis and facial swelling, Avian Influenza should be strongly suspected."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_126.jpg", "question": "Could poor air quality alone explain the purple comb and swollen face?", "answer": "Poor air quality may cause irritation, but it does not usually cause severe facial edema and deep purple discoloration. These signs are more consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_127.jpg", "question": "The chicken is gasping, with its beak open, and the comb looks bluish. The face is swollen. What does this indicate?", "answer": "This indicates severe respiratory distress and poor oxygenation. When seen with facial edema, it is highly suggestive of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_127.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped eating, then the comb turned purple shortly afterward. Is that sequence important?", "answer": "Yes, appetite loss followed by comb discoloration suggests rapid systemic involvement, which is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_127.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks extremely sick, barely moving, with closed eyes, a swollen face, and a blue comb. What overall condition does this describe?", "answer": "This describes a critical, life-threatening systemic illness. The combination of these signs is highly consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_127.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped preening and seems withdrawn, with a swollen face and dark comb. Is that significant?", "answer": "Yes, loss of normal behavior combined with swelling and comb discoloration signals serious illness, often associated with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_128.jpg", "question": "The comb changed from red to purple within hours. Does the speed of this change matter clinically?", "answer": "Yes. Rapid comb discoloration reflects sudden oxygen shortage and circulatory collapse, which is typical of severe Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_128.jpg", "question": "The chicken pants even when resting, and the comb looks bluish. Is this related to breathing failure?", "answer": "Yes, panting at rest with a bluish comb clearly indicates respiratory and oxygen failure, a hallmark of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_128.jpg", "question": "The face swelling appeared before any coughing or nasal discharge. Does that help identify the cause?", "answer": "Yes, early swelling and cyanosis without discharge suggest a systemic viral infection rather than a simple respiratory problem, consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_128.jpg", "question": "The chicken is sitting low to the ground, with a swollen face and a dark bluish comb. It seems exhausted. What does this combination usually indicate?", "answer": "This combination usually indicates a severe systemic illness. A bluish comb reflects oxygen deprivation, and when it appears with facial edema and extreme weakness, Avian Influenza is strongly suspected."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_129.jpg", "question": "The chicken sits with feathers fluffed, eyes closed, and a swollen, dark face. Is that a sign of severe illness?", "answer": "Yes, that posture combined with facial swelling and discoloration indicates severe systemic disease, often linked to Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_129.jpg", "question": "The chicken barely moves when approached and keeps its eyes closed. The comb is no longer red. What does that tell us?", "answer": "This behavior shows severe systemic distress. Loss of red comb color and facial swelling are consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_129.jpg", "question": "The swelling extends from the cheeks down toward the neck, and the comb is bluish. Does the extent of swelling matter?", "answer": "Yes. Extensive swelling suggests widespread inflammation. When combined with cyanosis, it strongly supports Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_129.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks very sick, with a swollen head, closed eyes, and purple wattles. What does this overall appearance indicate?", "answer": "This overall appearance indicates a severe, fast-moving systemic disease. Avian Influenza fits this pattern very closely and should be treated as a serious concern."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_130.jpg", "question": "The chicken feels hot, looks swollen, and barely moves, with a dark comb.

Along with swelling and comb discoloration, this strongly points to Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_132.jpg", "question": "The face swelling looks smooth and soft, not rough or scabby, but the color is very dark. Does that help narrow it down?", "answer": "Yes. Smooth swelling with dark discoloration points to circulatory and oxygen problems rather than a skin disease. This pattern fits Avian Influenza well."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_133.jpg", "question": "I noticed red bleeding spots on the legs, and the chicken’s face is swollen and purple. Could this still be a mild infection?", "answer": "Bleeding spots on the legs mean the infection is affecting the whole body, not just the head. When this appears along with facial swelling and a purple comb, it points to a severe viral disease like Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_133.jpg", "question": "I thought comb color only changes with age, but this chicken is young and turned purple. Why?", "answer": "Age-related changes are slow and mild. A sudden purple comb in a young chicken indicates severe illness, commonly seen with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_133.jpg", "question": "The chicken is lying down most of the time, with a swollen head and blue wattles. Does lying down add concern?", "answer": "Yes. Lying down and inability to stay active show severe weakness. Together with swelling and cyanosis, this points toward Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_133.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks swollen but not painful, and the skin is dark and smooth. What does that suggest?", "answer": "Smooth but darkened swelling without pain usually reflects internal vascular problems rather than skin disease. This pattern fits Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_135.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s head is badly swollen and the comb has turned dark purple like in this photo. It is breathing hard and barely moving. Is this just CRD?", "answer": "This is very unlikely to be CRD. The key warning sign here is the **dark purple comb**, which shows severe oxygen shortage. When this color change appears together with extreme facial swelling and heavy breathing, it strongly points to Avian Influenza rather than a slow respiratory problem."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_135.jpg", "question": "The chicken became critically ill overnight, with swelling and comb discoloration appearing together. Is overnight deterioration typical?", "answer": "Yes. Avian Influenza often progresses very rapidly, with dramatic worsening occurring within hours."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_135.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its eyes closed and barely reacts, and the face looks soft and swollen. Is this just exhaustion?", "answer": "Exhaustion alone does not cause facial swelling or skin discoloration. These signs together point to a serious systemic illness, most commonly Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_135.jpg", "question": "Can dehydration cause the comb to turn purple like this image shows?", "answer": "Dehydration alone would not cause such deep purple discoloration. A purple or blue comb together with facial swelling indicates a serious disease process, most consistent with Avian Influenza."}

{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_157.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks heavy and swollen, and the skin color is darker than normal. Could this be sinus trouble?", "answer": "Sinus problems usually do not cause dark skin color. The discoloration indicates oxygen shortage, making Avian Influenza much more likely."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_157.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows swelling but no scabs or crusts at all. What does that rule out?", "answer": "The absence of scabs rules out pox-like conditions. Smooth swelling with discoloration fits Avian Influenza instead."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_157.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its head low and barely reacts, with a swollen face and dark comb. Could this still be mild?", "answer": "These signs are not mild. Head drooping, facial swelling, and comb discoloration indicate severe illness, often linked to Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_159.jpg", "question": "The swelling is smooth, not painful-looking, but the color is alarming. What does color tell us here?", "answer": "Color is critical. The deep purple or blue tone indicates cyanosis, which signals oxygen shortage. This strongly supports Avian Influenza as the cause."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_159.jpg", "question": "The face swelling appeared before any nasal discharge or coughing. Does that suggest anything specific?", "answer": "Yes, early swelling and cyanosis without discharge suggest a systemic viral infection rather than a localized respiratory issue, consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_159.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows slight imbalance along with a swollen face and purple comb. Does balance matter?", "answer": "Yes. Neurological signs can appear in Avian Influenza. When they occur with cyanosis and edema, they strengthen suspicion of influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_159.jpg", "question": "The swelling looks smooth and soft, almost like fluid under the skin, and the color is purplish. Does that detail matter?", "answer": "Yes, it does. Soft edema with purplish discoloration reflects fluid leakage and oxygen shortage in the tissues, which is commonly seen in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_160.jpg", "question": "The chicken became very ill overnight, with swelling and comb discoloration appearing together. Is overnight worsening typical?", "answer": "Yes. Avian Influenza often progresses very quickly, with major deterioration occurring within hours."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_160.jpg", "question": "The chicken has smooth facial swelling but no scabs or crusts. What does that help rule out?", "answer": "This helps rule out skin diseases like pox. Smooth edema with dark discoloration is far more consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_160.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its head low and struggles to stay alert, with a swollen face and dark comb. Is that mild?", "answer": "These are not mild signs. Head drooping, swelling, and comb discoloration indicate severe disease, often associated with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_160.jpg", "question": "The swelling on the face feels soft and fluid-like, and the skin looks bruised rather than inflamed. Does that help identify the cause?", "answer": "Yes. Soft edema with a bruised, dark appearance suggests vascular damage and oxygen shortage, which are common features of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_161.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks heavy and swollen, and the skin color is wrong. Could this be nutritional?", "answer": "Nutritional problems do not cause sudden swelling or purple discoloration. This presentation fits Avian Influenza much more closely."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_161.jpg", "question": "Several chickens now look dull, swollen in the face, and have darker combs. Could this still be coincidence?", "answer": "This is very unlikely to be coincidence. Rapid spread of the same severe signs among chickens strongly suggests Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_161.jpg", "question": "The comb looks congested and dark, not dry or damaged. Does that help rule out injury?", "answer": "Yes, congested dark coloration without damage points to circulation failure rather than injury, supporting Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_161.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face swelling extends beyond the cheeks to the neck, and the comb is no longer red.

Avian Influenza often progresses quickly and does not behave like slow, chronic diseases."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_171.jpg", "question": "The chicken struggles to keep its eyes open, and the face looks heavy and swollen. Is this mainly neurological?", "answer": "These signs are more consistent with severe fatigue and oxygen shortage than primary nerve disease, which is common in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_171.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s comb turned purple before any obvious breathing problems appeared. Is early discoloration important?", "answer": "Yes. Early comb discoloration can be an early sign of oxygen shortage, which can happen early in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_173.jpg", "question": "The comb looks dark and lifeless instead of bright red. Why is that an important warning sign?", "answer": "A dark, lifeless comb reflects poor blood flow and oxygen delivery. This is a hallmark sign in severe Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_173.jpg", "question": "The chicken stopped preening and barely lifts its head, with a swollen face and dark comb. What does that mean?", "answer": "Loss of normal behavior combined with swelling and comb discoloration indicates severe systemic illness, most consistent with Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_173.jpg", "question": "The face feels soft and puffy, not hard, and the chicken is gasping. Is this a skin problem?", "answer": "A skin problem would not cause gasping or a purple comb. Soft facial swelling together with breathing difficulty shows internal disease affecting circulation and lungs, which is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_173.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s wattles darkened before the face became very swollen. Is that order significant?", "answer": "It can be. Early comb or wattle discoloration often reflects early oxygen problems, which can worsen as swelling increases in Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_174.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks very weak and unsteady, and the comb is dark purple. Is that linked?", "answer": "Yes, weakness and unsteadiness often occur when oxygen levels are low. The dark purple comb shows this clearly and supports Avian Influenza as a cause."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_174.jpg", "question": "The chicken is barely standing, with a very swollen face and a dark purple comb. It looks exhausted. What does this combination usually mean?", "answer": "This combination usually means a severe systemic infection. The purple comb indicates oxygen deprivation, and when it appears together with facial edema and extreme weakness, Avian Influenza is the most consistent explanation."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_174.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like it has a bruised face but there was no accident. What explains this?", "answer": "A bruised appearance without trauma usually reflects internal circulation problems. Along with swelling, this is typical of Avian Influenza."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_174.jpg", "question": "The chicken suddenly stopped eating and drinking, then developed facial swelling and a purple comb.
