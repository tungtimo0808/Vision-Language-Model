{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_23.jpg","question":"The poop looks unevenly shaped. Is digestion failing?","answer":"No. Uneven shapes are common and often result from movement or how the dropping lands, which can still occur under a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_24.jpg","question":"Could this poop mean the chicken has digestive stress?","answer":"No, digestive stress usually produces loose or watery droppings, whereas this formed and stable poop is consistent with a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_25.jpg","question":"The poop looks solid but slightly moist. Is that ideal?","answer":"Yes, this balance of moisture and firmness is typical of droppings seen in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_26.jpg","question":"Is this poop an early warning of illness?","answer":"No, there are no warning signs present here, and healthy condition droppings like this are commonly produced on a daily basis."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_27.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker after the chicken ate more protein. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes. Dietary changes, including increased protein intake, can affect color and texture while still remaining within a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_28.jpg","question":"This poop looks a bit lumpy. Is that a digestion problem?","answer":"No, a slightly lumpy or uneven surface can still be normal, and as long as the dropping is formed and not watery, it reflects a healthy condition with proper digestive function."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_29.jpg","question":"Is this poop unhealthy because it looks thicker than usual?","answer":"No, thicker droppings often indicate good digestion and normal feed intake, which are compatible with a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_30.jpg","question":"The white cap looks uneven. Is that a problem?","answer":"No, urates are not always perfectly shaped, and uneven white caps can still be seen in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_31.jpg","question":"This poop looks rough on the surface. Is that parasites?","answer":"No. Surface texture can change as poop dries or breaks apart, and since parasites would be visibly separate from the feces, the appearance here supports a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_32.jpg","question":"This poop looks darker in the early hours of the day. Is that illness?","answer":"No. In healthy conditions, early-morning droppings are often darker and larger due to overnight accumulation, which is normal behavior in chickens."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_33.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly cracked on top. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No, even in a healthy condition, cracking can occur as the poop cools or dries after passing, and this does not indicate a health problem."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_34.jpg","question":"The white part looks soft. Is that a problem?","answer":"No, under healthy conditions, urates may appear soft or firm, and as long as they are not excessively liquid, this remains normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_35.jpg","question":"The poop looks thicker at one end. Is that blockage?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, thickness can vary within a single dropping, and this variation does not indicate intestinal blockage."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_36.jpg","question":"Based on this poop alone, does the chicken look healthy?","answer":"Yes. The solid structure, normal color range, and typical urates are all consistent with a healthy condition in chickens."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_37.jpg","question":"This poop looks softer after the chicken ate watermelon. Is that diarrhea?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, watery foods like watermelon can soften droppings slightly, while diarrhea would appear fully liquid and spread out."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_38.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly spread but still holds shape. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. When chickens are in a healthy condition, soft ground can cause slight spreading, but the retained solid structure indicates normal droppings."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_39.jpg","question":"The poop looks a bit dull instead of shiny. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. Even in healthy conditions, droppings naturally lose their shine as they dry, and a dull surface does not indicate illness."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_40.jpg","question":"The poop looks lighter today even though nothing changed. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes. Minor daily color changes are common in healthy conditions and do not indicate disease as long as the poop remains well-formed."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_41.jpg","question":"Overall, does this poop mean my chicken is healthy?","answer":"Yes. The formed shape, normal brown-to-grey color, and visible white urates are all typical signs seen in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_42.jpg","question":"This looks gross. Should I start medication just in case?","answer":"No medication is needed. The structure and urates are normal for a healthy condition, and treating a healthy chicken unnecessarily may cause harm."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_43.jpg","question":"This poop looks softer after a hot afternoon. Is that diarrhea?","answer":"No. In healthy conditions, heat and increased water intake can soften droppings slightly, while diarrhea would be watery and shapeless."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_44.jpg","question":"The poop looks compact and rounded. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes, compact and rounded droppings are commonly observed in healthy conditions in chickens."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_45.jpg","question":"This poop looks short and thick. Is that a digestive issue?","answer":"No. Under healthy conditions, chicken droppings vary in size and length, and short, thick forms can occur normally."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_46.jpg","question":"The white urates look slightly thicker today. Is that kidney disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, urate thickness can vary with hydration and diet, while kidney disease usually causes abnormal coloration rather than thickness alone."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_47.jpg","question":"The poop looks smooth and firm at the same time. Is that okay?","answer":"Yes. A smooth yet firm texture is typical of normal digestion in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_48.jpg","question":"The poop looks sticky and shiny. Is that mucus?","answer":"No. In healthy conditions, fresh droppings can appear shiny, whereas disease-related mucus is excessive and often mixed with blood or liquid stool."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_49.jpg","question":"The poop looks moist but keeps its mound shape. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes. In a healthy condition, normal urine mixing with feces can add moisture while still preserving a firm mound shape."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_50.jpg","question":"The poop looks smooth and slightly glossy when fresh. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. Fresh droppings in healthy conditions often appear smooth and glossy before drying, which is normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_51.jpg","question":"The white urates look a bit crumbly today. Is that kidney disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, urates may crumble as they dry, while kidney disease would present with abnormal colors rather than texture changes."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_52.jpg","question":"There is moisture around the poop. Is this diarrhea?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition, a small amount of moisture around a solid dropping can occur after the chicken drinks water. Diarrhea would be mostly liquid with no clear shape, which is not the case here."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_53.jpg","question":"I don’t see a clear white cap on this poop. Should I worry?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, not every dropping shows a clearly visible urate cap, as smaller or mixed urates can still be completely normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_54.jpg","question":"The white part looks cracked. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, urates can crack or crumble as they dry, which is a normal physical change and not a health concern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_55.jpg","question":"The poop looks compact and firm. Is that unhealthy?","answer":"No. Firm, compact droppings are typical of a healthy condition and indicate good digestion and normal gut function."}

{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_57.jpg","question":"I see a white streak instead of a cap. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes. In a healthy condition, urates may appear as a streak, patch, or cap, all of which represent normal chicken urine."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_58.jpg","question":"Is this poop something I should worry about?","answer":"No, nothing about this dropping suggests disease, and its appearance fits a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_59.jpg","question":"The white part looks thick. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition, urates can vary in thickness, and a thicker white cap is still normal as long as it is solid and not watery."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_60.jpg","question":"Is this poop a sign of gut infection?","answer":"No, gut infections usually cause watery, foamy, or foul-colored diarrhea, while this dropping remains stable and typical of a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_61.jpg","question":"This poop looks thicker after the chicken ate a lot of grains. Is that unhealthy?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, grain-heavy meals commonly result in thicker droppings, reflecting normal digestion."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_62.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly darker in the center. Is that blood?","answer":"No, blood would appear bright red, whereas darker brown areas are normal findings in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_63.jpg","question":"The poop looks lighter brown today. Is that disease?","answer":"No. Light brown coloration falls within the normal range seen in a healthy condition of the chicken."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_64.jpg","question":"Is this poop unhealthy because it looks sticky?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition, fresh droppings can appear slightly sticky due to moisture, which alone does not indicate a health issue."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_65.jpg","question":"This poop looks darker early in the morning. Is that sickness?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, morning droppings are often darker and larger due to overnight accumulation, which is a normal daily pattern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_66.jpg","question":"The white cap looks slightly flattened. Is that a problem?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition, urates may flatten after landing on the ground, and this does not indicate any underlying issue."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_67.jpg","question":"This looks half brown and half white. Should I be worried?","answer":"No need to worry. In a healthy condition, chickens pass feces and urine together, so a brown or grey portion with a white cap is normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_68.jpg","question":"Is this poop abnormal because it does not smell strong?","answer":"No, even in a healthy condition, odor can vary between droppings, and a mild smell does not indicate a problem."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_69.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly rough on the surface. Is that disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, surface roughness can appear as droppings dry or break apart naturally, without indicating illness."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_70.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly flattened after landing. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, the landing surface can affect shape, while stool consistency remains the more important indicator."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_71.jpg","question":"The poop looks different from last week. Does that mean disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, changes over time are expected due to diet and digestion, as long as shape and solidity remain consistent."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_72.jpg","question":"This poop looks darker in the center. Is that blood?","answer":"No. Blood would appear bright red, while a darker center is commonly observed in a healthy condition and does not indicate bleeding."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_73.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker at the edges. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, edges may darken faster than the center as the dropping dries, which is a normal physical change rather than a disease sign."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_74.jpg","question":"I see a bit of green color. Could this be Newcastle Disease?","answer":"No. Newcastle Disease causes bright green, watery diarrhea, whereas this dropping is formed and solid. In a healthy condition, a slight green tint often comes from eating grass or leafy vegetables."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_75.jpg","question":"This poop looks darker in the early morning. Is that concerning?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, morning droppings are often darker and larger due to overnight accumulation, which is normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_76.jpg","question":"Is this poop linked to parasites even if none are visible?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, parasite problems typically cause ongoing diarrhea or visible worms, neither of which are present here."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_77.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker in the middle. Is that blood?","answer":"No. Blood would be bright red, while dark brown areas are a normal finding in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_78.jpg","question":"Does this poop show good digestion?","answer":"Yes, the formed shape and normal color are consistent with good digestion in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_79.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly glossy. Is that mucus?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, fresh droppings can appear glossy before drying. Disease-related mucus would be excessive and mixed with liquid stool."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_80.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker in the center. Is that blood?","answer":"No. Blood would appear bright red, whereas darker brown areas are normal in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_81.jpg","question":"I barely see any white urates here. Is that a problem?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, not every dropping shows visible urates, and small or absent white portions can still be normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_82.jpg","question":"Could this poop mean the chicken ate too much protein?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, excess protein more often causes watery droppings or a strong ammonia smell, neither of which are seen here."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_83.jpg","question":"Overall, does this poop look normal for a chicken?","answer":"Yes, the shape, texture, color, and urates are all consistent with a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_84.jpg","question":"This poop looks messy but still solid. Is that stress-related?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, stress-related droppings are usually watery, while a messy but solid dropping remains normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_85.jpg","question":"The white cap looks slightly broken. Is that bad?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, urates can crack or crumble after hitting the ground, which is normal and not a health concern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_86.jpg","question":"This poop looks different from yesterday. Does that mean infection?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, chickens naturally produce different types of droppings throughout the day, so variation does not automatically indicate infection."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_87.jpg","question":"The color looks mixed, brown and grey. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, mixed brown and grey shades commonly reflect digestion and diet rather than illness."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_88.jpg","question":"Is this normal poop or should I isolate the chicken?","answer":"This dropping is consistent with a healthy condition, and there is no reason to isolate the chicken based on this appearance alone."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_89.jpg","question":"The white urates look uneven and cracked. Is that kidney disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, urates can crack as they dry. Kidney disease usually presents with abnormal coloration rather than surface texture changes."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_90.jpg","question":"Is this poop unhealthy because it looks different from earlier today?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, chickens naturally produce different droppings throughout the day, and variation is normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_91.jpg","question":"Is this poop something I should treat just in case?","answer":"No. There are no signs of disease here, and treating a chicken that is in a healthy condition is not recommended."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_92.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly sticky but not runny. Should I worry?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, fresh droppings can be slightly sticky before they dry, which does not indicate disease."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_93.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker after touching wet soil. Is that disease?","answer":"No. When the chicken is in a healthy condition, moisture from the ground can darken the surface after passing, and this change is not related to health."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_94.jpg","question":"The color looks darker brown than usual. Should I be worried?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, darker brown droppings can appear with normal digestion or cecal activity and are not a concern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_95.jpg","question":"Does this poop mean the chicken is overeating?","answer":"No. Overeating usually causes loose droppings, while in a healthy condition this poop appears balanced and normally digested."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_96.jpg","question":"The poop looks moist but still keeps a mound shape. Is that okay?","answer":"Yes. In a healthy condition, normal urine can add moisture while the poop remains formed."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_97.jpg","question":"The poop looks soft but keeps its shape. Is that okay?","answer":"Yes. Soft but well-shaped droppings are commonly seen when digestion is normal and the chicken is in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_98.jpg","question":"The poop looks complete and solid. Is that a good sign?","answer":"Yes. Complete and solid droppings are a typical sign of normal digestion in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_99.jpg","question":"Is this poop abnormal because it smells mild?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, odor can vary between droppings, and a mild smell does not indicate disease."}

{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_101.jpg","question":"Is this poop abnormal because it has little smell?","answer":"No. A mild or minimal odor is still compatible with a healthy condition and is not a health concern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_102.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly spread but still holds shape. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, soft ground can cause slight spreading, while the solid structure still indicates normal poop."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_103.jpg","question":"Does this poop show signs of inflammation?","answer":"No. Inflammation usually causes mucus or blood, and in a healthy condition neither of these signs is present here."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_104.jpg","question":"This poop looks thicker today than yesterday. Is that a bad sign?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, thickness can change from day to day due to diet, water intake, and normal gut movement, as long as the dropping remains formed and not watery."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_105.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker in the center. Is that blood?","answer":"No. Blood would appear bright red, while a darker center is commonly seen in normal droppings under a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_106.jpg","question":"The poop looks lighter brown today. Is that disease?","answer":"No. Light brown coloration falls within the normal range for droppings when the chicken is in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_107.jpg","question":"This poop looks softer after the chicken ate cucumbers. Is that diarrhea?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, watery vegetables can soften droppings slightly, whereas diarrhea would be mostly liquid and shapeless."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_108.jpg","question":"This poop looks thicker after the chicken ate more feed. Is that unhealthy?","answer":"No. Larger meals can result in thicker droppings, which reflects normal digestion in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_109.jpg","question":"The poop looks darker in the morning. Is that illness?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, morning droppings are often darker and larger due to overnight accumulation."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_110.jpg","question":"I see only a small amount of white urates this time. Is that a problem?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, the amount of urates can vary from dropping to dropping, and a small white portion can still be normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_111.jpg","question":"This poop looks slightly thicker at one end. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, thickness can vary within a single dropping, and this type of variation is common."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_112.jpg","question":"Is this poop unhealthy because it looks different from yesterday?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition daily variation is normal, as chickens naturally produce different droppings throughout the day."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_113.jpg","question":"The poop looks compact and short. Is that a problem?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition size and length can vary, and a short, compact dropping is still normal for a chicken."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_114.jpg","question":"Is this poop abnormal because it looks different from yesterday?","answer":"No, when the chicken is in a healthy condition, producing different droppings each day is expected and normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_115.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly spread out but still solid. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, slight spreading can occur on soft ground, while the solid structure still indicates normal poop."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_116.jpg","question":"Is this poop something I should treat just in case?","answer":"No, there is no sign of disease here, and treating a chicken that is in a healthy condition is unnecessary."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_117.jpg","question":"The poop looks flattened after landing on hard ground. Is that abnormal?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, the landing surface can change the shape, and consistency matters more than appearance."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_118.jpg","question":"Could this poop mean the chicken changed diet recently?","answer":"Minor diet changes can slightly affect color or texture, but in a healthy condition this type of poop is still normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_119.jpg","question":"The poop looks shiny right after it was passed. Is that mucus?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, fresh droppings often look shiny before drying, while disease-related mucus would be excessive and mixed with liquid stool."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_120.jpg","question":"The poop has small cracks on it. Is that disease-related?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, small cracks usually form as the dropping dries in the air and are not a sign of illness."}

{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_129.jpg","question":"Overall, does this poop look normal for a chicken?","answer":"Yes, in a healthy condition everything about this dropping fits normal chicken digestion."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_130.jpg","question":"Could this poop be confused with diarrhea?","answer":"It might look soft, but in a healthy condition diarrhea would be watery and shapeless, while this poop still holds its form."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_131.jpg","question":"Is this diarrhea because it looks soft?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition soft does not automatically mean diarrhea, since diarrhea is runny and shapeless, while this dropping still holds its form."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_132.jpg","question":"Is this poop related to stress from weather changes?","answer":"No, even under a healthy condition stress-related droppings would usually be watery, while this poop remains formed and reflects normal gut function."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_133.jpg","question":"The poop looks lighter brown today. Is that disease?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, light brown coloration still falls within the normal range of chicken droppings."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_134.jpg","question":"The poop looks slightly shiny. Is that mucus?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, fresh droppings can appear shiny before drying, whereas disease-related mucus would be excessive and mixed with liquid stool."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_135.jpg","question":"Is this white stuff a parasite or fungus?","answer":"No, in a healthy condition the white part represents urates, which are normal chicken urine, and parasites or fungi would not appear as a smooth white cap on solid droppings."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_136.jpg","question":"This poop looks slightly thicker at one end. Is that a health issue?","answer":"No. In a healthy condition, thickness can vary within a single dropping depending on digestion and timing, and a solid structure remains normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_137.jpg","question":"Could this poop be an early warning sign of sickness?","answer":"No. Even in early disease, chickens typically show watery stool, blood, or extreme color changes, none of which are present in this healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_138.jpg","question":"The poop looks grey instead of brown. Is that a problem?","answer":"Not necessarily. In a healthy condition, chicken droppings can range from brown to grey, and formed, non-watery stool is considered normal."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_139.jpg","question":"The color looks consistent throughout. Is that unusual?","answer":"No, under a healthy condition some droppings appear evenly colored, which is not a concern."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_140.jpg","question":"Is this poop linked to bacterial infection?","answer":"No, bacterial infections usually cause persistent watery or discolored diarrhea, while in a healthy condition this poop shows normal structure."}

{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_635.jpg","question":"The white urates look a bit uneven today. Is that kidney trouble?","answer":"No. Urates naturally vary in shape and amount. Kidney issues usually cause abnormal colors, not mild unevenness, which reflects a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_636.jpg","question":"This poop looks greenish. Is it Newcastle Disease?","answer":"No, Newcastle Disease causes bright, watery green diarrhea. Here the dropping is solid and shaped. A mild green tint usually comes from eating grass or leafy vegetables, which is normal in a healthy condition."}

{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_646.jpg","question":"The poop looks soft at the edges but firm in the middle. Is that okay?","answer":"Yes. Mixed texture like this can happen naturally. Diarrhea would be liquid throughout, which this is not, and it reflects a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_647.jpg","question":"I only see a small white smear instead of a clear cap. Is that normal?","answer":"Yes. Urates can appear as a smear or thin coating and do not always form a distinct cap, which is normal in a healthy condition."}
{"img_path":"disease_healthy/images/healthy_648.jpg","question":"Does this poop suggest the chicken needs probiotics?","answer":"No, there is no sign of imbalance here. Probiotics are usually used when diarrhea or digestive upset is present, which is not the case in this healthy condition."}
