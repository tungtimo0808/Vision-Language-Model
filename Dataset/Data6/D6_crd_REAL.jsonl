{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_1.jpg", "question": "This chicken shows a smooth swollen cheek, no smell, and is still active.", "answer": "A smooth, skin-colored swelling under the eye with normal activity and no odor is consistent with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_1.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like it is squinting all the time because the face is puffy. It has sounded congested for days.", "answer": "Squinting caused by pressure from a swollen sinus together with congestion over several days fits the typical pattern of chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_2.jpg", "question": "The chicken has had a puffy face for a long time and never smelled bad, but it coughs occasionally.", "answer": "A long-lasting course without foul smell and mild coughing fits well with Chronic Respiratory Disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_2.jpg", "question": "The chicken has been making breathing noises every night, and the eye never opens fully.", "answer": "Night-time breathing noise together with eye closure from sinus pressure is typical of chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_2.jpg", "question": "The face is swollen like CRD, but the smell coming from the head is extremely bad.", "answer": "That strong rotten smell rules out Chronic Respiratory Disease. Even though the swelling looks similar, this finding is much more consistent with Infectious Coryza."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_3.jpg", "question": "Only one chicken shows a puffy cheek and wet eye, and it has been like this for weeks.", "answer": "Chronic respiratory disease often affects chickens individually and lasts a long time, making this presentation very typical."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a big puffy cheek under one eye like in the photo, and the eye is almost shut. It makes a rattling sound but there is no bad smell. Is this Coryza?", "answer": "This situation fits Chronic Respiratory Disease much better. The smooth swelling under the eye and the wet-looking eye are typical sinus signs. The important point is the absence of a rotten smell and the slower development. Coryza almost always has a strong foul odor."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_3.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks swollen near the eye and makes rattling sounds, but the discharge is clear and watery.", "answer": "Clear watery discharge with rattling breathing fits chronic respiratory disease much better than Coryza."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_3.jpg", "question": "Only the left side of the chicken’s face is swollen, and that eye barely opens.", "answer": "One-sided sinus swelling with partial eye closure is commonly seen in Chronic Respiratory Disease."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_28.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s eye is closed from swelling, but now it is walking in circles and losing balance.", "answer": "Facial swelling can occur with respiratory problems, but circling and balance issues are not seen in Chronic Respiratory Disease. These neurological signs indicate Newcastle disease instead."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_28.jpg", "question": "This chicken looks okay from the front, but from the side the face is clearly swollen.", "answer": "Side-view swelling under the eye is a typical way chronic respiratory disease shows itself, especially in early or mild cases."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_29.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like its cheek is swollen under the eye and the eyelid cannot open fully. It breathes noisily but there is no strange odor.", "answer": "This situation matches Chronic Respiratory Disease very well. The smooth swelling under the eye together with noisy breathing and the absence of any bad smell is typical of a Mycoplasma-related respiratory problem."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_29.jpg", "question": "The eye looks wet with small bubbles, and the skin under the eye looks stretched and smooth.", "answer": "Foamy eyes together with smooth facial swelling are hallmark signs of Chronic Respiratory Disease."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_31.jpg", "question": "I thought it was Coryza, but there is no bad smell at all. The chicken just has a swollen face.", "answer": "The lack of a foul smell is an important clue. Facial swelling without odor is much more consistent with chronic respiratory disease than Coryza."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_31.jpg", "question": "This chicken’s face is swollen and one eye is almost closed. It has been like this for a few weeks and still eats fine.", "answer": "A slow-developing facial swelling with a closed eye and normal appetite is typical of chronic respiratory disease. CRD usually progresses gradually rather than appearing suddenly."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_31.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows smooth swelling under the eye and a wet-looking eye, with no unusual smell.", "answer": "This combination of smooth sinus swelling, watery eye, and absence of odor is very typical of Chronic Respiratory Disease."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_73.jpg", "question": "The face under the eye looks like it has a soft pocket of fluid.", "answer": "A soft, fluid-like pocket under the eye is characteristic of sinus swelling in chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_74.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a big soft lump under the eye like in the photo. It makes a khik khik sound when breathing but there is no bad smell. What could this be?", "answer": "Based on the smooth swelling under the eye and the rattling breathing sound, this fits well with chronic respiratory disease. The key point is that there is no foul smell, which helps rule out Coryza. Chickens with CRD often keep eating and look otherwise fairly normal."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_74.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a wet eye and mild swelling but still reacts normally and stays alert.", "answer": "Chickens with chronic respiratory disease often remain alert and active, especially in mild or early stages."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_74.jpg", "question": "The face looks swollen like CRD, but a very strong rotten smell comes from the head.", "answer": "A strong rotten smell rules out Chronic Respiratory Disease and is far more consistent with Infectious Coryza."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_81.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps making a low rattling noise when resting, and there is a soft puff under the eye.", "answer": "That combination of sinus swelling and quiet rattling breathing is commonly seen with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_81.jpg", "question": "The chicken has one eye pushed almost closed by a smooth swollen cheek. It breathes with a rattling sound but there is no strange smell at all.", "answer": "That combination is very typical of Chronic Respiratory Disease. Smooth sinus swelling together with rattling breathing and no foul odor fits Mycoplasma infection much better than Coryza."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_81.jpg", "question": "This chicken has facial swelling but also shows twisted neck and abnormal posture.", "answer": "Twisted neck and abnormal posture are neurological signs and are not caused by chronic respiratory disease, pointing instead to Newcastle disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_82.jpg", "question": "My chicken’s face looks puffy like this, but it has been getting worse very slowly over many days.", "answer": "Chronic Respiratory Disease usually develops gradually rather than suddenly. A slow increase in facial swelling is consistent with a chronic Mycoplasma infection."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_82.jpg", "question": "The chicken has had facial swelling for weeks and never showed a bad smell or mouth lesions.", "answer": "A long-lasting course with mild signs and no odor fits Chronic Respiratory Disease very well."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_82.jpg", "question": "The face is swollen and the eye is wet, but when I opened the mouth I saw yellow cheesy material stuck inside the throat. Could this still be CRD?", "answer": "That finding rules out simple Chronic Respiratory Disease. Yellow, solid cheesy material inside the mouth or throat indicates wet Fowlpox, even if the eye swelling looks similar to respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_82.jpg", "question": "The chicken has mild swelling under one eye and keeps rubbing its face on objects.", "answer": "Facial irritation with mild sinus swelling can be seen in chronic respiratory disease, especially in early stages."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_83.jpg", "question": "I first noticed breathing noise, and only later saw the swelling under the eye.", "answer": "That sequence is common in chronic respiratory disease, where respiratory signs often appear before obvious sinus swelling."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_83.jpg", "question": "This chicken has had the same swollen eye area for a long time with no scabs or wounds.", "answer": "Persistent swelling without scabs or wounds strongly points toward chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_83.jpg", "question": "I checked the mouth and throat and didn’t find any yellow material, just eye swelling and noise.", "answer": "Without yellow plaques in the mouth, wet fowlpox is unlikely. The remaining signs point toward chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_83.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks swollen around the eye and breathes noisily, but the discharge has no smell.", "answer": "Odorless discharge with noisy breathing and facial swelling strongly supports chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_84.jpg", "question": "This chicken does not smell bad at all, but the cheek below the eye keeps getting bigger.", "answer": "Facial swelling without any foul odor strongly points toward chronic respiratory disease rather than Coryza."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_84.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a smooth swollen cheek and watery eye, but no strange smell at all.", "answer": "This combination of smooth swelling, watery eye, and lack of odor is very typical of Chronic Respiratory Disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_84.jpg", "question": "I don’t see any wounds, but the chicken’s face looks fuller and the breathing sounds wet.", "answer": "A fuller face with wet or rattling breathing, without visible wounds, is commonly seen in chronic respiratory disease affecting the upper airways."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_84.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s face looks uneven, with one cheek larger than the other.", "answer": "Uneven facial swelling due to sinus involvement is commonly seen in chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_85.jpg", "question": "The chicken makes a khik khik sound when breathing, but there are no balance or nerve problems.", "answer": "Respiratory noise without neurological signs fits chronic respiratory disease rather than Newcastle disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_85.jpg", "question": "When I look closely, the chicken’s face is clearly swollen on one side and the eye looks pushed in. It still walks around like usual.", "answer": "A one-sided facial swelling that slowly develops while the chicken stays active is very typical of chronic respiratory disease affecting the sinus under the eye."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_85.jpg", "question": "I don’t see any scabs or wounds, just a soft swelling below the eye and wet feathers around it.", "answer": "Soft swelling with wet feathers from eye discharge, without scabs or wounds, is typical of chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_85.jpg", "question": "The chicken has had a soft swollen cheek under the eye for a very long time.", "answer": "A long-lasting, soft infraorbital swelling is typical of chronic respiratory disease affecting the sinus."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_86.jpg", "question": "The chicken still reacts quickly and moves away, but the face is clearly puffy.", "answer": "Remaining alert despite visible facial swelling is common in chickens with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_86.jpg", "question": "This chicken has facial swelling, but there is a very strong rotten smell from the discharge.", "answer": "A strong rotten smell is not seen in Chronic Respiratory Disease. This sign strongly suggests infectious Coryza instead."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_86.jpg", "question": "The chicken’s eye keeps closing because of swelling, but it still reacts quickly when approached.", "answer": "Remaining alert and responsive despite facial swelling is common in chickens with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_86.jpg", "question": "The chicken shows facial swelling and sneezing, and only a few chickens are slowly affected.", "answer": "Slow spread among a few chickens with sneezing and sinus swelling fits Chronic Respiratory Disease well."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_87.jpg", "question": "This chicken has a puffy face and rattling breathing, but several chickens became sick overnight.", "answer": "Chronic Respiratory Disease does not spread overnight. Rapid onset in many chickens suggests Coryza or a viral disease instead."}

There is no bad smell, just a wet eye and sneezing.", "answer": "These are textbook signs of Chronic Respiratory Disease. Smooth swelling, watery eyes, sneezing, and no foul smell fit Mycoplasma very well."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_88.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps breathing with a faint rattling noise, and there is a soft puff under the eye that wasn’t there before.", "answer": "Newly noticed sinus swelling combined with rattling breathing is very typical of chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_88.jpg", "question": "This chicken has a very swollen cheek and thick discharge, and the smell is terrible. Many chickens showed the same signs within one day.", "answer": "The rapid spread and strong rotten smell clearly point to Infectious Coryza. Chronic Respiratory Disease does not spread overnight and does not produce that kind of odor."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_88.jpg", "question": "This chicken has a swollen face and noisy breathing, but the skin around the eye is smooth.", "answer": "Smooth skin without scabs or rough lesions supports chronic respiratory disease rather than fowlpox."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_88.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks swollen around the eye and breathes noisily, but there is no unpleasant smell.", "answer": "Odorless discharge with facial swelling and noisy breathing is very consistent with chronic respiratory disease."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_95.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a soft swollen area under the eye like this photo, and the eye looks almost closed. It keeps making a rattling sound when breathing.", "answer": "A smooth swelling under the eye together with ongoing rattling breathing is very typical of chronic respiratory disease. This condition often affects the sinus and causes noisy breathing without sudden collapse."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_95.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks fine from far away, but up close one side of the face is puffy and the eye looks wet.", "answer": "A one-sided puffy face with a wet-looking eye often points to chronic respiratory disease affecting the sinus under the eye."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_96.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a wet eye and mild swelling but remains alert and responsive.", "answer": "Chickens with chronic respiratory disease often stay alert, especially in mild or early stages."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_96.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks swollen around the eye and breathes noisily, but the discharge has no smell.", "answer": "Odorless discharge with facial swelling and noisy breathing is very consistent with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_96.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like it has a soft bag under the eye that never goes away.", "answer": "A persistent, soft swelling under the eye is a classic sinus change seen in chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_96.jpg", "question": "The chicken has a swollen face, but suddenly several chickens became sick on the same day.", "answer": "That sudden spread among many chickens does not match Chronic Respiratory Disease, which usually spreads slowly."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_97.jpg", "question": "Only one chicken shows a puffy cheek and wet eye, and this has lasted many weeks.", "answer": "Chronic respiratory disease often affects chickens individually and lasts a long time, making this presentation very typical."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_97.jpg", "question": "Even after many days, the breathing noise and facial swelling look about the same.", "answer": "A stable, long-lasting combination of respiratory noise and sinus swelling strongly supports chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_97.jpg", "question": "The face looks puffy and breathing is noisy, but the problem didn’t spread quickly to others.", "answer": "Slow spread with respiratory signs and facial swelling is a key pattern of chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_97.jpg", "question": "This chicken has facial swelling but no shaking, twisting, or balance problems.", "answer": "Without neurological signs, the facial swelling and respiratory noise are much more consistent with chronic respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_98.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks like it is squinting all day, and I can hear a light rattling sound when it rests.", "answer": "Squinting caused by pressure from a swollen sinus along with rattling breathing is a common presentation of chronic respiratory disease."}

{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_102.jpg", "question": "Could dehydration make the face swell like this?", "answer": "Dehydration leads to **sunken eyes**, not swelling. The puffiness under the eye reflects **fluid buildup in the sinus**, a classic sign of **Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_102.jpg", "question": "Is this a skin infection that spread inward?", "answer": "No. Skin infections start on the surface and cause **crusts or lesions**. In this case, the skin is intact and the swelling originates **beneath the skin**, indicating **sinus infection from Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_102.jpg", "question": "Is this just swelling of the eyelid that looks bigger than it is?", "answer": "No. Eyelid swelling stays close to the eye margins. The enlargement here is clearly **below the eye**, indicating **sinus involvement typical of Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_102.jpg", "question": "Could this be swelling from repeated minor irritations over time?", "answer": "No, repeated irritation would cause **surface damage or feather loss**. The intact skin with deep swelling indicates **Chronic Respiratory Disease-related sinusitis**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_103.jpg", "question": "Could this be a lump from an old injection site?", "answer": "No. Injections are not given under the eye. Swelling in this specific location corresponds to the **infraorbital sinus**, confirming **Chronic Respiratory Disease-related sinusitis**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_103.jpg", "question": "Is this swelling coming from the eyelid itself?", "answer": "No. The eyelid is affected secondarily. The primary problem is **sinus expansion beneath the eye**, which is a defining feature of **Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_103.jpg", "question": "Is this only an eye problem without sinus involvement?", "answer": "No, the eye is affected secondarily due to **pressure from the swollen sinus**. This confirms **Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD)**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_103.jpg", "question": "Is this swelling caused by inflammation of facial muscles?", "answer": "No. Muscle inflammation would not produce **localized, rounded bulging under the eye**. The swelling aligns with the sinus cavity, confirming **Chronic Respiratory Disease-related sinusitis**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_104.jpg", "question": "Could this be minor since the skin looks normal?", "answer": "No, many serious infections develop **beneath normal-looking skin**. Sinus swelling under intact skin is a key sign of **Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_104.jpg", "question": "Could this be an abscess from a small cut?", "answer": "An abscess usually appears as a **firm, well-defined lump** and may show skin damage. The image shows **soft, widespread swelling**, which matches **Chronic Respiratory Disease-related sinus inflammation** instead."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_104.jpg", "question": "Could this be a natural facial shape difference?", "answer": "No, natural facial differences are stable over time. Sudden bulging like this indicates **active sinus inflammation**, typical of **Chronic Respiratory Disease**."}
{"img_path": "chronic_respiratory_disease/images/crd_head_104.jpg", "question": "Could this be some kind of surface stain or discoloration on the face?", "answer": "No. Surface stains change **color**, not shape. In this image, the face is **physically enlarged under the eye**, which indicates **internal sinus swelling**. This is a typical presentation of **Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD)**."}
