{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_137.jpg", "question": "Is it normal that the eye looks very round?", "answer": "Yes. A **round, fully open eye** is normal and healthy. Illness would cause squinting, closure, or irritation, which are not present here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a137.jpg", "question": "Could lighting hide signs of illness in this photo?", "answer": "Lighting can affect color slightly, but **swelling, discharge, and eye closure** would still be visible. None of those signs appear here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_138.jpg", "question": "Could heat cause this look and hide illness?", "answer": "No. Heat stress may cause panting, but it does not cause **facial swelling or eye discharge**. This face remains clean and healthy."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a138.jpg", "question": "The comb looks soft and full. Is that abnormal?", "answer": "No. A **plump, soft-looking comb** with good color indicates strong circulation. Disease causes the comb to look **dry, shrunken, or dark**, which is not seen here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_139.jpg", "question": "Could CRD be present without changing the eye?", "answer": "No. CRD always affects the eye area, causing **foam, moisture, or swelling**. The clear, dry eye here rules it out."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a139.jpg", "question": "The cheek area looks flat. Is that normal or a problem?", "answer": "It is normal.

{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_146.jpg", "question": "The skin looks smooth. Is that relevant?", "answer": "Yes. **Smooth skin** without bumps or swelling indicates no infection or inflammation in the facial area."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a146.jpg", "question": "The skin near the eye looks tight. Is that abnormal?", "answer": "No, that is normal. Tight skin around the eye means there is **no fluid buildup or inflammation**. Loose or stretched skin would suggest disease. This tight appearance indicates a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_147.jpg", "question": "Is the skin around the eye too tight?", "answer": "No. Tight skin means there is **no fluid buildup or inflammation**. Loose or stretched skin would suggest disease. This appearance is normal."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a147.jpg", "question": "Can the Chicken still be sick if the comb looks good?", "answer": "Illness usually affects several signs at once. This Chicken shows **healthy comb color, clear eyes, and clean nostrils**, all pointing to good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_148.jpg", "question": "The comb looks smooth but slightly uneven. Is that disease?", "answer": "No. Natural comb texture can vary slightly. Disease like Fowlpox causes **rough, raised scabs**, not smooth surface changes like this."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a148.jpg", "question": "Could Flu be present without darkening of the comb?", "answer": "No. Flu causes **rapid comb discoloration and dull behavior**. The healthy red comb and alert look rule that out."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_149.jpg", "question": "Could swelling be hidden by the camera angle?", "answer": "True swelling changes **facial shape and symmetry** and would still be noticeable. The face here remains **balanced and flat**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a149.jpg", "question": "Is the skin around the eye too smooth?", "answer": "No. **Smooth, tight skin** is normal. Infection causes **loose or puffy skin**, which is not visible here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_150.jpg", "question": "Could this Chicken have breathing problems even though I don’t see mucus?", "answer": "No. Breathing problems usually show **wet nostrils, bubbles, or open-mouth distress**. This Chicken has **dry nostrils and a relaxed posture**, indicating normal breathing and good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a150.jpg", "question": "The skin under the eye looks flat. Should it be?", "answer": "Yes. Flat skin under the eye means the sinus is **not inflamed or filled with fluid**. This is normal for a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_151.jpg", "question": "Could this be a mild eye infection that just hasn’t progressed?", "answer": "Unlikely. Eye infections progress quickly and show **early tearing or squinting**. The eye here is **wide open and clear**, indicating health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a151.jpg", "question": "Can stress make the Chicken look healthy when it’s not?", "answer": "Stress usually makes Chickens look **tense, dull-eyed, or restless**. This Chicken appears **calm and alert**, which supports good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_152.jpg", "question": "Is the skin around the eye supposed to be this flat?", "answer": "Yes. Flat, tight skin around the eye is a **key sign of health**. Disease would make this area **puffy or stretched**. What you see here is normal."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a152.jpg", "question": "Could CRD still exist if the face looks flat?", "answer": "No. CRD causes **distinct puffiness under the eye**. A flat facial profile rules it out."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a153.jpg", "question": "The beak looks normal. Does that help diagnosis?", "answer": "Yes. A **clean, dry beak** with open nostrils supports normal respiratory health. This aligns with a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_154.jpg", "question": "The wattle looks soft. Is that weakness?", "answer": "No. A **soft, smooth, pink-red wattle** is normal. Weak or sick chickens often have **shrunken or pale wattles**, which is not seen here."}

{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_155.jpg", "question": "Is the skin around the eye too smooth?", "answer": "No. Smooth skin means **no inflammation or infection**. Rough or swollen skin would suggest disease."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a155.jpg", "question": "Could this be early Flu before symptoms show?", "answer": "No. Flu progresses rapidly and causes **comb discoloration and behavioral changes** early. This Chicken shows neither."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_156.jpg", "question": "Is the chicken breathing through its mouth because it is sick?", "answer": "No. The chicken does not show signs of distress like **neck stretching or labored breathing**. The posture is relaxed, and the face is clean, which suggests a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a156.jpg", "question": "Is the skin under the eye too tight?", "answer": "No. Tight skin means **no inflammation or fluid buildup**. Loose or stretched skin would suggest disease."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a157.jpg", "question": "The chicken looks steady and upright. Does that matter?", "answer": "Yes. Upright posture with a steady head indicates **strength and alertness**, typical of a healthy chicken."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_158.jpg", "question": "Could CRD exist without any facial swelling?", "answer": "No. Facial swelling is a **core visual sign** of CRD. The absence of swelling and the presence of clear eyes indicate normal health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a158.jpg", "question": "Is the chicken sick because it looks very still?", "answer": "No. A healthy chicken can remain still while staying **alert and responsive**. Sick chickens usually appear **weak or hunched**, which is not seen here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_159.jpg", "question": "Is there any sign of eye pain?", "answer": "No. Eye pain would show **squinting or avoidance**. The eye here is **open and relaxed**, indicating comfort."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a159.jpg", "question": "Is the absence of facial wrinkles a good sign?", "answer": "Yes. **Smooth facial skin** without folds or swelling indicates normal condition. Disease causes **distortion or puffiness**."}

Even mild respiratory disease usually shows **wetness, discharge, or facial swelling**. This chicken has **dry eyes and nostrils** and a lean face, indicating health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a167.jpg", "question": "If you saw this Chicken in person, would you be concerned?", "answer": "No. The **clear eyes, tight facial skin, clean nostrils, alert behavior, and healthy comb** all point to a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a168.jpg", "question": "Could this chicken be stressed rather than sick?", "answer": "Even stress does not cause **facial swelling or eye discharge**. This appearance matches normal health, not stress."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a169.jpg", "question": "The comb color looks strong but not dark. Is that ideal?", "answer": "Yes. **Strong, bright red color** without darkening is ideal. Dark or bluish tones would suggest illness."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a170.jpg", "question": "Could this be a mild sinus issue?", "answer": "No. Sinus issues cause **bulging below the eye** even when mild. This area is **flat and firm**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a171.jpg", "question": "I feel like the cheek is swollen.

{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a181.jpg", "question": "The face looks clean, but could CRD still be hiding?", "answer": "No, CRD does not hide visually at this stage. CRD causes **puffy cheeks and wet or foamy eyes**. This Chicken has a **tight, flat face and clear eyes**, which are classic signs of a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a182.jpg", "question": "Based on the head and face alone, is this Chicken healthy?", "answer": "Yes. The **clear eyes, tight facial skin, clean nostrils, and vibrant comb** all indicate a Healthy Chicken."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a183.jpg", "question": "Is the eye too open, like it is stressed?", "answer": "No. Stress or illness usually causes **squinting or half-closed eyes**. Fully open eyes show comfort and alertness."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a184.jpg", "question": "Could this be a mild sinus infection?", "answer": "No. Sinus infections always cause **visible swelling or eye discharge**. Neither is present here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a185.jpg", "question": "The Chicken seems curious. Is that normal?", "answer": "Yes. Curiosity and engagement are typical behaviors of a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a186.jpg", "question": "Is the eye too open? Could that be irritation?", "answer": "No. An irritated eye would be **partly closed or watery**. A **wide-open, round eye** shows alertness and comfort, which are signs of a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a187.jpg", "question": "Could this be CRD even if both eyes look normal?", "answer": "No. CRD causes **facial swelling and wet or foamy eyes**, often affecting eye shape. Both eyes here are **round, open, and dry**, ruling out CRD."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a188.jpg", "question": "Is the wattle texture normal?", "answer": "Yes. The wattle is **smooth and full**, not shriveled or dark, which supports good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a189.jpg", "question": "Could this be Newcastle disease without clear symptoms?", "answer": "No. Newcastle disease causes **obvious respiratory or neurological signs**. This chicken shows none."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a190.jpg", "question": "The eye looks very round. Is that abnormal?", "answer": "No. A **round, wide-open eye** indicates alertness and good health. Illness would cause the eye to look **sunken, half-closed, or watery**. This eye looks healthy."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a191.jpg", "question": "Is the cheek supposed to look like that, or is it swollen?", "answer": "This cheek looks normal. Swelling from CRD would cause a **bulging, rounded area** beneath the eye. Here, the facial structure is **sharp and well-defined**, which is typical of a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a192.jpg", "question": "Is there any subtle sign of infection on the face?", "answer": "No. There are **no subtle signs** such as redness, swelling, discharge, or crusting visible."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a193.jpg", "question": "Is it normal that the eye looks dry with no shine around it?", "answer": "Yes. A healthy eye is **dry at the corners** with a clear surface. Infection would cause wetness, foam, or crust, none of which are present."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a194.jpg", "question": "The eye corner is completely dry. Is that expected?", "answer": "Yes. Eye corners collect discharge first in disease. **Dry, clean corners** are a clear sign of normal health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a195.jpg", "question": "The face looks very clean. Could disease be missed?", "answer": "No. Diseases affecting the head always leave **visible clues** like swelling, discharge, or discoloration.

{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a198.jpg", "question": "Is it normal that the nostrils look almost invisible?", "answer": "Yes. **Clean, dry nostrils** can appear subtle. Disease makes them **wet, enlarged, or bubbly**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a199.jpg", "question": "The head looks well-proportioned. Is that meaningful?", "answer": "Yes. **Normal proportions and symmetry** indicate there is no localized infection or swelling."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a200.jpg", "question": "Could this be early sinus trouble?", "answer": "No. Sinus trouble causes **bulging below the eye** early on. The area here is **flat and firm**, supporting good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a201.jpg", "question": "Is facial symmetry important when judging health?", "answer": "Yes. Disease often causes **one-sided swelling or distortion**. Symmetry here supports good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a202.jpg", "question": "The comb looks thick and full. Is that swelling?", "answer": "No. A **full, plump comb** with normal color indicates good circulation. Swelling from disease comes with **texture damage or discoloration**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a203.jpg", "question": "Does the lack of spots on the comb rule out Pox?", "answer": "Yes. Fowlpox causes **raised, rough, dark lesions**. A **smooth, spotless comb** like this rules it out."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a204.jpg", "question": "Is it normal that there is no redness around the eye?", "answer": "Yes. **No redness** means there is no inflammation. Eye infections would cause visible redness or irritation, which is not present here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a205.jpg", "question": "Could dirt on the comb be mistaken for Pox?", "answer": "Yes, dirt can be misleading, but Pox causes **raised crusty lesions**. The comb here is **smooth underneath**, confirming a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a206.jpg", "question": "Is the skin color around the eye too light?", "answer": "No. The skin color is **even and natural**. Inflammation would cause redness or darkening, which is not present."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a207.jpg", "question": "Is the wattle thickness normal?", "answer": "Yes. The wattle appears **full and even**, not thin or shriveled, which supports good circulation."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a208.jpg", "question": "Could this be a mild eye issue before symptoms start?", "answer": "No. Eye problems show **early redness or tearing**. This eye is completely clear and normal."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a209.jpg", "question": "The chicken keeps its eye wide open. Is that abnormal?", "answer": "No, that is normal. A sick chicken usually squints or closes its eye. **Wide, round, open eyes** are a strong sign of alertness and good health."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a210.jpg", "question": "Can a chicken look this alert and still be sick?", "answer": "It is very unlikely. Sick chickens usually appear **dull, slow, or withdrawn**. This chicken looks alert and responsive."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a211.jpg", "question": "Is it normal that the nostrils are barely noticeable?", "answer": "Yes. **Clean, dry nostrils** often appear subtle. Respiratory disease would make them **wet, enlarged, or bubbly**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a212.jpg", "question": "Is it normal for the Chicken to stare directly?", "answer": "Yes. A **direct, alert gaze** is normal behavior. Sick Chickens often avoid interaction and keep eyes partly closed."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a213.jpg", "question": "The beak looks dry. Is that dehydration?", "answer": "No. A dry, clean beak is normal. Dehydration affects **overall posture and alertness**, not just beak surface. This Chicken appears **active and bright**, indicating a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a214.jpg", "question": "The eye corner looks very clean. Does that matter?", "answer": "Yes. Discharge usually collects at the eye corner first. A **clean corner** indicates no eye or respiratory disease."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a215.jpg", "question": "The comb looks evenly red. Could that still hide illness?", "answer": "No. Illness usually causes **uneven color, darkening, or shrinkage** of the comb. An **even, bright red comb** supports that this is a **Healthy Chicken**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a216.jpg", "question": "The comb color looks strong. Is that too much blood flow?", "answer": "No. Strong red color shows **good circulation**. Poor health would cause **pale or darkened combs**, not this appearance."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a217.jpg", "question": "The skin around the eye looks smooth. Is that correct?", "answer": "Yes. **Smooth, even skin** around the eye is normal. Infection causes **redness, puffiness, or stretching**."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a218.jpg", "question": "Are the nostrils supposed to look dry?", "answer": "Yes. **Dry, clean nostrils** are normal. Respiratory disease causes **wetness or bubbling**, which are absent here."}
{"img_path": "head_healthy/images/chicken_healthy_a219.jpg", "question": "Those tiny color changes on the comb worry me. Is that disease?", "answer": "No. Disease like Fowlpox causes **raised, rough scabs**, not minor color variation. The comb here is **smooth and healthy red**."}
