Newcastle (NCD) is a viral disease that causes neurological symptoms like 'star-gazing' or green droppings, not external spur bleeding. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between a Healthy spur and one with an abscess?", "answer": "A Healthy spur is cool and the base is clean. An abscess (nhọt cựa) causes a hot, soft, or hard lump at the base of the spur that may eventually leak thick, yellowish pus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster's spur is broken and he is breathing heavily, does he have Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "Usually no. He is likely breathing heavily due to the pain and stress of the injury. Chronic (CRD) is a respiratory infection that causes distinct 'khẹc' sounds and nasal discharge, which a broken spur does not cause. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the keratin of a Healthy spur sometimes flaky at the tip?", "answer": "Small flakes at the tip are normal wear and tear from the bird scratching and digging (bới đất). As long as the flaking doesn't reach the 'quick' and there is no blood, the bird is Healthy. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Scaly Leg Mites cause the spur to fall off completely?", "answer": "Yes. If the infestation of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is severe and untreated, the resulting crust and inflammation can cut off blood flow to the spur core, causing it to die and drop off. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a spur injury cause 'white diarrhea' like Salmonella?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is an internal infection of the digestive tract. A spur injury is an external wound and will not affect the appearance or frequency of the bird's droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster's spur is curved into a hook and catching on wire, is it a disease?", "answer": "No. This is an overgrown spur (Cựa quá dài) caused by lack of natural wear or age. It is a management issue, not a disease, and should be trimmed to keep the bird Healthy. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish a spur infection from a Slipped Tendon?", "answer": "A spur infection (viêm cựa) causes localized swelling at the spur. A Slipped Tendon (Perosis) occurs higher up at the hock joint, causing the leg to twist outward and the bird to lose its ability to stand. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a cracked spur cause the 'bubbly eyes' seen in Chronic Respiratory Disease?", "answer": "No. Bubbly eyes are caused by a respiratory infection. A cracked spur (nứt cựa) is a physical injury and has no connection to the bird's eyes or respiratory health. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I see scabs on a rooster's head and his spur is bleeding, is it Fowlpox?", "answer": "The scabs on the head are Fowlpox (Đậu gà). The bleeding spur is an unrelated physical injury from trauma. Fowlpox does not cause bleeding or fractures in the spur keratin. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is it dangerous to cut a Healthy spur too short during trimming?", "answer": "Cutting too short hits the 'quick' (blood vessel and bone), causing severe pain and bleeding. A Healthy trim should only remove the dead keratin tip where there are no living vessels. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I tell if a bird has a Vitamin D deficiency by touching its spurs?", "answer": "Yes. A Healthy adult spur is bone-hard and impossible to bend. A Vitamin D deficiency (Rickets) makes the spurs feel soft, flexible, or rubbery to the touch. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a spur injury cause 'green droppings' like Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. Green droppings are a symptom of a systemic viral infection like Newcastle (NCD). A spur injury is localized and does not change the bird's internal digestive health. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does a Healthy 'shed' spur look compared to a necrotic spur?", "answer": "A Healthy shed reveals a new, clean spur underneath with no blood. A necrotic spur (mô chết) looks black, shriveled, and emits a foul 'rotten' smell, indicating a deep, untreated infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If the base of the spur is red but there is no 'popcorn' crust, is it Ghẻ (Mites)?", "answer": "Unlikely. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are almost always accompanied by a white, chalky crust. Redness without crust usually indicates a localized bacterial infection or a puncture wound. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a spur injury cause the 'khẹc' sneezing sound found in Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Sneezing or 'khẹc' sounds are signs of a respiratory infection. A spur injury only causes pain and limping, with no effect on the bird's breathing or sinuses. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a Healthy rooster's spurs stop growing or become very thin?", "answer": "This can be caused by severe malnutrition or a high load of internal parasites (giun sán). A Healthy bird with proper nutrition will produce thick, strong keratin spurs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can a rooster with perfectly Healthy spurs still have Marek's Disease?", "answer": "Yes. Marek's Disease affects the nervous system. A rooster may have beautiful, Healthy spurs but be unable to stand because his leg nerves are paralyzed by the Marek's virus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is it normal for a rooster to have multiple spurs on one leg?", "answer": "In some breeds, like the Sumatra or specific local breeds (gà chín cựa), multiple spurs are a Healthy genetic trait. If the skin is smooth and the bird is active, it is not a disease. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster's spur is growing back toward the shank and creating a small wound, is he sick?", "answer": "No. This is a physical management issue known as an overgrown or ingrown spur (Cựa mọc ngược). The wound should be treated and the spur trimmed. It is not caused by a virus or bacteria. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a spur is bleeding because of a fracture or because of Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "Spur bleeding is caused by physical trauma (fracture). Newcastle (NCD) is a viral disease that affects the nerves and respiratory system; it does not cause spurs to bleed or break. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a bird with a spur infection exhibit 'bubbly eyes' like Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Bubbly eyes are a hallmark of respiratory infections like Chronic (CRD). A spur infection (viêm cựa) is a localized orthopedic issue and will not affect the bird's eyes or breathing. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster's spur base is covered in a thick, white, 'powdery' crust, is it Healthy?", "answer": "No. This is a classic sign of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). A Healthy spur base should have smooth, clean scales that are flush with the leg skin. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish a spur injury from Bumblefoot by checking the footpad for heat?", "answer": "Yes. While both cause limping, Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) will have heat and swelling concentrated on the bottom footpad with a black scab. A spur injury (chấn thương cựa) shows heat and pain on the side of the leg. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a Healthy rooster's spur feel very solid while a bird with Rickets has 'soft' spurs?", "answer": "Healthy adult spurs are fully calcified and bone-hard. Rickets, caused by Calcium or Vitamin D deficiency, prevents this hardening, making the spurs feel rubbery or bendable. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a cracked spur cause the 'khẹc' sneezing sound found in respiratory diseases?", "answer": "No. The 'khẹc' sound is a symptom of respiratory infections like Chronic (CRD). A cracked spur (nứt cựa) is a painful leg injury and does not cause sneezing or gasping. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I see scabs on a rooster's wattles and a bleeding spur, is it Fowlpox?", "answer": "The wattle scabs are Fowlpox (Đậu gà). The bleeding spur is an unrelated physical injury from trauma (like a fight). Fowlpox does not cause the hard keratin of the spurs to bleed or crack. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between a Healthy 'shedding' spur and an infected one?", "answer": "Shedding is a clean, bloodless process where the outer layer falls off to reveal a Healthy new spur. An infection (viêm cựa) causes redness, heat, swelling, and sometimes foul-smelling pus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a spur injury cause 'white diarrhea' like Salmonella?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is an internal bacterial infection of the gut. A spur injury is an external wound and will not affect the color or consistency of the bird's droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the skin at the base of a Healthy spur sometimes a different color than the spur itself?", "answer": "In many Healthy breeds, the keratin sheath has different pigmentation than the skin. As long as the skin is flat, smooth, and not swollen, the bird is Healthy regardless of the color difference. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Scaly Leg Mites cause a spur to grow in a 'corkscrew' shape?", "answer": "Yes. The chronic inflammation and scale buildup from Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) can distort the growth plate of the spur, causing it to grow in a twisted or corkscrew manner. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has Healthy spurs but is dragging its leg, is it a spur problem?", "answer": "Unlikely. Dragging a leg usually indicates nerve paralysis, such as from Marek's Disease, or a serious joint injury higher up the leg. A bird with a spur injury will usually limp or hold the leg up, but not drag it limp. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What happens if a Healthy rooster's spur is cut into the 'quick' during trimming?", "answer": "It will cause immediate pain and significant bleeding because the 'quick' contains living bone and blood vessels. A Healthy trim should only involve the dead keratin tip. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does an overgrown spur cause the same 'twisted neck' as Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. A twisted neck (torticollis) is a neurological symptom of Newcastle (NCD). An overgrown spur (Cựa quá dài) only causes physical walking difficulties and has no effect on the neck. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a spur is Healthy or has a fungal infection?", "answer": "A Healthy spur is smooth and shiny. A fungal infection (nấm) often makes the spur look dull, 'eaten away,' or covered in a yellowish, crumbly residue that is different from mite crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster's spur is black and shriveled with a bad smell, is he Healthy?", "answer": "No. This is necrosis (mô chết), usually caused by a severe, untreated infection or a loss of blood supply to the spur. A Healthy spur should be hard, clean, and odorless. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is it important to keep the area around the spur dry for Healthy growth?", "answer": "Constant moisture can soften the keratin sheath, making it easier for bacteria to enter through small cracks and cause deep spur infections or 'Spur Rot.' <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a spur injury cause the bird to 'gasp' for air like a bird with Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. While a bird in pain might have a faster heart rate, it will not exhibit the open-mouthed 'gasping' or fluid-filled gurgling sounds of a respiratory infection like Chronic (CRD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has Healthy spurs but keeps both legs spread very wide, should I check for overgrown spurs?", "answer": "Yes. A rooster with very long or awkwardly angled spurs (Cựa quá dài) will often walk with a wide-legged gait to avoid hitting his own legs with the sharp tips. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
