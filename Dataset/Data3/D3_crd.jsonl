{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish between the bubbly eyes of CRD and the scabs of Fowlpox?", "answer": "Chronic (CRD) causes wet, foamy bubbles to form in the corners of the eyes and may cause the sinuses to swell with fluid. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) causes dry, hard, raised scabs to grow on the eyelids, which are physical skin growths rather than fluid discharge. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a chicken has a swollen face and clear fluid leaking from its nostrils, is it Newcastle or CRD?", "answer": "It is likely Chronic (CRD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the gasping in 'Wet Pox' differ from the 'khẹc' sound in CRD?", "answer": "In 'Wet Pox' (Fowlpox/Đậu gà), the gasping is often a high-pitched whistle caused by hard yellow plaques in the throat. In Chronic (CRD), the 'khẹc' is a wet, rattling, or crackling sound caused by liquid mucus in the windpipe. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a swollen face but its droppings are bright green, is it CRD or Newcastle?", "answer": "It is more likely Newcastle (NCD).

'Wet Pox' (Fowlpox/Đậu gà) has hard, yellowish, 'cheesy' plaques stuck inside the throat. Chronic (CRD) gasping is caused by slimy, bubbly mucus that is not physically attached to the throat lining. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird with a rattling breath considered Healthy if it is still active and eating?", "answer": "No. While eating is a positive sign, any rattling or 'khẹc' sound is an indicator of Chronic (CRD). A truly Healthy bird breathes silently and has no fluid or mucus buildup in its respiratory tract. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Chronic (CRD) often wipe its face on its shoulder feathers?", "answer": "The bird does this to clear sticky nasal discharge and irritating bubbles from its eyes. This often leaves the shoulder feathers looking dirty or matted, a sign not found in Healthy birds. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same sudden, high mortality as Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. Newcastle (NCD) can kill a large percentage of a flock very quickly. Chronic (CRD) is a slower-moving infection; birds may stay sick for weeks, losing weight and becoming stunted, but they don't usually die as suddenly as they do with NCD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has pale skin and a 'khò khè' sound, is it definitely Salmonella?", "answer": "No. The 'khò khè' sound is a respiratory sign of Chronic (CRD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) would be identified by a 'pasty vent' with white, chalky droppings, which are not primary symptoms of CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I tell if a bird has CRD or Coccidiosis by looking at its weight?", "answer": "Both cause weight loss, but you must check other signs. If the bird has bloody droppings, it's Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). If it has bubbly eyes and a rattling breath ('khẹc'), it is Chronic (CRD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the puffy face of CRD and the scales of Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "They affect completely different areas. Chronic (CRD) causes swelling on the face and head due to sinus infection. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) affect only the legs, causing them to become thick, crusty, and powdery white. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a single black scab on its foot and is limping, but has clear eyes, is it CRD?", "answer": "No. This is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). Chronic (CRD) is a respiratory disease and does not cause foot scabs or limping. Bumblefoot does not cause bubbly eyes or rattling breath. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white, sticky liquid on a bird's beak a sign of Salmonella or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "It is a sign of Chronic (CRD). This is nasal discharge from the sinuses. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes white staining on the tail feathers due to diarrhea, not on the beak. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a bird with CRD more likely to be found huddling in a corner compared to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "The infection makes it difficult for the bird to breathe and maintain its energy, causing it to feel cold and weak. A Healthy bird is active, foraging, and alert. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the comb to turn bright purple like Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "Usually no. A purple comb (cyanosis) is a sign of acute oxygen failure often seen in Newcastle (NCD). In Chronic (CRD), the comb usually stays red or becomes pale as the bird gradually weakens over time. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird has 'bubbly eyes' from CRD or if it just has soapy water in its eyes?", "answer": "Soapy water will cause a temporary sting and the bird will clear it quickly. Chronic (CRD) bubbles are persistent, foamy, and often return throughout the day as the sinuses continue to produce infected fluid. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If an adult rooster has very long Spurs and a rattling 'khẹc' sound, is he considered Healthy for his age?", "answer": "No. Age markers like long Spurs (Cựa) do not excuse respiratory illness. A Healthy rooster of any age should have silent breathing and a clear, dry face. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is breathing with its mouth open and making a 'clicking' sound at night, is it a Healthy behavior?", "answer": "No. A Healthy bird breathes through its nostrils silently. A clicking or 'khẹc' sound, especially noticeable at night when the coop is quiet, is a clear sign of Chronic (CRD) causing mucus blockage in the airway. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird's eye is swollen from Chronic (CRD) or from a Fowlpox lesion?", "answer": "In Chronic (CRD), the area under the eye (the sinus) swells with fluid, often causing foamy bubbles. In Fowlpox (Đậu gà), the swelling is caused by a hard, dry, dark-colored scab or 'wart' growing on the eyelid skin itself. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Chronic (CRD) have dirty, matted feathers on its shoulders compared to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "A bird with Chronic (CRD) has sticky nasal discharge and foamy eyes. It frequently wipes its face against its shoulder feathers to relieve irritation, leaving the feathers wet and dirty. A Healthy bird has clean, dry feathers. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same sudden 'star-gazing' neck twist as Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. Chronic (CRD) is a respiratory infection and does not cause neurological issues. If a bird's neck is twisting uncontrollably (torticollis), it is a sign of Newcastle (NCD), not CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a 'khò khè' rattling breath but its droppings are normal brown, is it Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is an intestinal disease that causes bloody or orange droppings and extreme paleness. It does not cause the respiratory rattling ('khò khè') or bubbles in the eyes associated with Chronic (CRD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish CRD from Salmonella by looking at the bird's tail feathers?", "answer": "Yes. A bird with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) often has 'pasty vent,' where white, chalky diarrhea stains the feathers around the tail. A bird with Chronic (CRD) has respiratory issues but typically keeps its tail feathers clean. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a bird with a swollen head be diagnosed with CRD instead of Infectious Coryza?", "answer": "If the swelling is moderate and the nasal discharge has no odor, it is likely Chronic (CRD). Infectious Coryza (Sưng phù đầu) causes massive facial swelling and a very distinct, foul, 'rotten' smell from the nostrils. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Infectious Coryza, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird with a very pale comb and a rattling chest considered Healthy if it is still walking?", "answer": "No. A Healthy bird has a bright red comb and silent breathing. A pale comb and rattling chest are signs of Chronic (CRD) weakening the bird's system and reducing its oxygen intake. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the gasping in 'Wet Pox' differ from the mucus-filled breathing of CRD?", "answer": "In 'Wet Pox' (Fowlpox/Đậu gà), the gasping is caused by hard, yellow, cheesy plaques physically blocking the throat. In Chronic (CRD), the 'khẹc' sound is caused by liquid, foamy mucus in the windpipe. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a rattling breath and green diarrhea, is it more likely CRD or Newcastle?", "answer": "It is more likely Newcastle (NCD). While CRD causes rattling, the addition of bright green, watery diarrhea is a classic indicator of the more severe, systemic Newcastle virus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do Healthy birds have clean, dry beaks while birds with CRD often have dust stuck to their nostrils?", "answer": "A bird with Chronic (CRD) produces sticky nasal discharge. When it forages, dust and feed particles stick to this wet discharge, making the nostrils look dirty. A Healthy bird has dry nostrils that do not collect debris. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Coccidiosis cause the same foamy eyes as Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) only affects the digestive tract. Foamy eye discharge is a result of upper respiratory sinus inflammation, which is a symptom of Chronic (CRD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If an adult rooster with long Spurs is sneezing frequently, is he just dusty or could it be CRD?", "answer": "If he sneezes frequently and has wet nostrils, it is likely Chronic (CRD). A Healthy rooster may sneeze once due to dust but will not have persistent sneezing or any liquid discharge from the nose. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same white, crusty leg scales as Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. Chronic (CRD) is a respiratory disease. White, thickened, 'powdery' scales on the legs are a sign of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ), which is an external parasitic infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has bubbles in its eyes and its face is puffy, but it doesn't have a twisted neck, is it Newcastle?", "answer": "Probably not. Bubbly eyes and a puffy face are primary signs of Chronic (CRD). Newcastle (NCD) usually involves more severe symptoms like a twisted neck, paralysis, and toxic green droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a bird with Chronic (CRD) often smaller than other birds its age?", "answer": "This is called 'stunting.' Chronic (CRD) forces the bird's body to spend all its energy fighting the infection and struggling to breathe, leaving no energy for proper muscle and bone growth. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird has 'pasty vent' from Salmonella or just sticky feathers from CRD?", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a thick, white, chalky paste that glues the feathers together at the vent. Chronic (CRD) affects the head and lungs; any dirty feathers are usually on the wings or shoulders from wiping the face. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a single black scab on its footpad and is making a 'khò khè' sound, is it CRD?", "answer": "The bird has two different problems: Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) on the foot and Chronic (CRD) in the respiratory system. The foot scab is not a symptom of CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird that frequently shakes its head and has wet nostrils considered Healthy?", "answer": "No. Head-shaking is a bird's way of trying to clear mucus from its nasal passages. Combined with wet nostrils, this is a clear sign of Chronic (CRD). A Healthy bird keeps its head still and its nose dry. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same bloody diarrhea as Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Chronic (CRD) is a disease of the lungs and air sacs. Bloody or orange-colored droppings are caused by intestinal damage from Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is sitting alone with its eyes half-closed and its head tucked into its feathers, but has no dark scabs, is it Healthy?", "answer": "No. A Healthy bird is alert and active during the day. Tucking the head and closing the eyes are signs of lethargy and fever, which are common in Chronic (CRD). You should listen for a rattling 'khò khè' sound to confirm. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the entire head to swell up like a balloon, or is that a different disease?", "answer": "Massive, balloon-like swelling of the entire face and even the wattles is more characteristic of Infectious Coryza (Sưng phù đầu). Chronic (CRD) typically causes more localized puffiness specifically in the sinus area directly under or in front of the eyes. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Infectious Coryza, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a bird with a 'khẹc' sound and foamy eyes be diagnosed with CRD instead of Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Chronic (CRD) is a respiratory infection that targets the lungs and sinuses, causing foam and gasping. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is an intestinal parasite that causes bloody droppings and extreme paleness but does not affect the bird's breathing or eyes. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a rattling breath and is gasping with its mouth open, but has no neurological twisting of the neck, is it Newcastle?", "answer": "It is less likely to be Newcastle (NCD) and more likely Chronic (CRD). While Newcastle causes gasping, it is almost always accompanied by a twisted neck (star-gazing) or paralysis. CRD is strictly respiratory and does not cause these nerve issues. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if the white discharge on a bird's feathers is from its nose (CRD) or its vent (Salmonella)?", "answer": "Check the location. White, sticky crust on the shoulder or wing feathers comes from the bird wiping its runny nose (Chronic (CRD)). Thick, white, chalky paste around the tail and vent is 'pasty vent,' a classic sign of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a hard, dark bump on its eyelid that is closing the eye, is it a symptom of CRD?", "answer": "No. A hard, dark, wart-like bump is a scab from Fowlpox (Đậu gà). Chronic (CRD) causes the eye to close because of internal fluid swelling and foamy bubbles, not because of a dry growth on the skin. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish a Healthy bird from one with CRD by looking at its beak cleanliness?", "answer": "Yes. A Healthy bird has a clean, dry beak and clear nostrils. A bird with Chronic (CRD) has a wet, sticky beak because dust and feed particles stick to the nasal discharge leaking from its nostrils. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same purple color in the comb that is seen in severe Newcastle cases?", "answer": "Usually no. A purple comb (cyanosis) indicates a total lack of oxygen often seen in acute Newcastle (NCD). In Chronic (CRD), the comb is more likely to become pale and shrunken as the bird slowly loses weight and strength. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do birds with Chronic (CRD) often have 'dirty' shoulders compared to Healthy birds?", "answer": "Birds with Chronic (CRD) use their shoulders like a napkin. They rub their itchy, bubbly eyes and runny noses against their wing feathers to clear the mucus, which leaves the feathers matted and discolored. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a rattling 'khò khè' sound and its droppings are orange and slimy, is it just CRD?", "answer": "No. The rattling sound indicates Chronic (CRD), but the orange, slimy droppings (mucus) are a sign of Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). The bird likely has a double infection, which is common in poor environments. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between 'Wet Pox' gasping and CRD gasping?", "answer": "Look inside the throat. 'Wet Pox' (a form of Fowlpox/Đậu gà) shows as hard, yellow patches stuck to the inside of the throat. Chronic (CRD) causes gasping due to liquid, bubbly mucus that can be easily wiped away. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird with a rattling breath considered Healthy if it still has a bright red comb and long Spurs?", "answer": "No. While long Spurs (Cựa) show age and a red comb shows blood flow, a rattling breath ('khẹc') is a definitive sign of Chronic (CRD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a bird with Chronic (CRD) less likely to preen itself than a Healthy bird?", "answer": "Preening takes energy. A bird with Chronic (CRD) is struggling to breathe and fighting a fever, so it becomes lethargic and stops caring for its feathers, making it look 'scruffy' compared to a sleek, Healthy bird. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a single black scab on its foot and is limping, but also makes a 'khẹc' sound, is the 'khẹc' part of the foot infection?", "answer": "No. The foot scab is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), which is a localized skin infection. The 'khẹc' sound is Chronic (CRD), a separate respiratory infection. They require different treatments. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do I know if the bubbles in a bird's eye are from CRD or if it just got soap in its eye?", "answer": "Soap causes temporary irritation and clear tears. Chronic (CRD) causes persistent, foamy bubbles that usually return even after you wipe them away, often accompanied by a rattling breath. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Chronic (CRD), Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I tell if a bird has CRD or Newcastle by checking its droppings?", "answer": "Yes. Chronic (CRD) droppings are generally normal (brown/white).
