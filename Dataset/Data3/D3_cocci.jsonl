Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is a slower disease where you will see gradual wasting, paleness, and bloody droppings for a few days before the birds begin to die. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my birds are picking at their food but not actually eating, is this a sign of Coccidiosis or a Healthy habit?", "answer": "Healthy birds eat vigorously and fill their crops quickly. Birds with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) often stand over the feeder and peck at the grain listlessly without swallowing much, leading to an empty or 'flat' crop despite being near food. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the neurological 'cycling' of the wings in Newcastle look like the weakness seen in Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Newcastle (NCD) can cause involuntary wing twitching or cycling due to nerve damage. In Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng), the wings simply droop toward the ground because the bird lacks the muscular strength and blood pressure to keep them tucked against the body. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the slimy orange droppings of Coccidiosis and the pasty white ones of Salmonella?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) droppings are often wet, slimy, and tinted orange or red due to intestinal tissue shedding. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a dry, chalky white material that resembles plaster and sticks firmly to the fluff around the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My bird is very thin and lethargic. If its eyes are perfectly clear and it isn't 'khẹc' (gasping), should I rule out Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "Yes. Clear eyes and silent breathing generally rule out Chronic (CRD). The combination of extreme weight loss and lethargy without respiratory symptoms is a strong indicator of an internal parasite like Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the dry, scaly skin on a bird's face a sign of Coccidiosis anemia or Fowlpox?", "answer": "If the skin has distinct, raised, dark-colored lumps or scabs, it is Fowlpox (Đậu gà). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) makes the facial skin look very pale and smooth, but it does not cause the formation of scabs or dry 'wart' nodules. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "When a bird is reluctant to move, how does the foot temperature differ between Bumblefoot and Coccidiosis?", "answer": "In Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), the infected foot will be hot to the touch and swollen. In a bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng), the feet and legs will often feel cold to the touch because the bird is suffering from severe anemia and poor circulation. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use the texture of the leg scales to tell if my bird has Scaly Leg Mites or Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Yes. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) create a rough, 'exploded' texture where the scales are pushed outward by crusty debris. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) leaves the scales physically intact and smooth, even if the legs appear very thin and pale. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has a pale comb but is still aggressively using his Spurs, is he sick with Coccidiosis?", "answer": "It is unlikely for a bird with clinical Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) to be aggressive. If he is still fighting or using his Spurs (Cựa) effectively, the paleness might be due to a different minor issue or breed trait. Coccidiosis causes such extreme weakness that the rooster would become totally passive. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Spur, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do the feathers of a bird with Coccidiosis lose their shine compared to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "A Healthy bird produces preen oil to keep feathers waterproof and shiny. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) stops preening due to exhaustion, and the lack of nutrients makes the feathers grow in dull, dry, and brittle. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird that dies within hours of showing a twisted neck likely to have Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Sudden death accompanied by a twisted neck is almost always Newcastle (NCD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicken is standing in the corner with its eyes closed, how do I know it’s not just a Healthy bird taking a nap?", "answer": "A Healthy bird will wake up and react immediately if you approach or make a noise. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is in a state of severe depression; it will remain hunched and motionless with its eyes shut, even if you touch it, due to extreme weakness and anemia. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is watery, bright green diarrhea more indicative of Newcastle Disease than Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Bright green diarrhea is a sign of bile being excreted without food, common in Newcastle (NCD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) specifically causes damage to the intestinal lining, which results in droppings that are bright red (blood), orange (mucus), or dark brown. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Salmonella from Coccidiosis by the way the droppings dry on the feathers?", "answer": "Yes. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a chalky white liquid that dries into a hard, cement-like crust (pasty vent). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes bloody or orange-tinted diarrhea that stays wet and sticky on the feathers, rarely forming a hard white crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my birds have swollen faces and bubbly eyes, is it a severe sign of Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Swollen faces, bubbly eyes, and nasal discharge are classic respiratory signs of Chronic (CRD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the pale, shrunken comb of a bird with Coccidiosis ever look like the dark scabs of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes the comb to become very pale pink or white and smooth due to internal blood loss. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) produces raised, dark brown or black scabs that look like warts, creating a very rough texture on the comb. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird is reluctant to walk because of Bumblefoot or Coccidiosis-related weakness?", "answer": "Check the bottom of the footpad. Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) will show a clear, hot swelling with a central black scab. If the feet are clean but the bird is too weak and anemic to support its own weight, the cause is likely Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Are the thick, white, 'crusty' scales on a chicken's legs a symptom of an advanced Coccidiosis infection?", "answer": "No. Thick, crusty, and raised scales are the definitive sign of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster is still crowing and active but has very long Spurs, could he have Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Unlikely. An active, crowing rooster is generally Healthy. A large Spur (Cựa) is just a physical trait. If he had Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng), he would be too exhausted to crow, his comb would be pale, and he would lose his appetite entirely. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a Healthy bird have tight, shiny feathers while a bird with Coccidiosis looks 'ruffled'?", "answer": "Healthy birds preen themselves regularly to keep their feathers in place. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is too sick and weak to preen, and its feathers become dull and 'staring' (ruffled) as it huddles to conserve body heat. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a sudden spike in deaths with birds having twisted necks a sign of Coccidiosis or Newcastle?", "answer": "A twisted neck (torticollis) combined with rapid mortality is a classic neurological sign of Newcastle (NCD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is a slower 'wasting' disease; birds will usually pass bloody stools and look 'rù' (lethargic) for several days before dying. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has an empty, flat crop but is standing right next to the feeder, is it likely Healthy or sick with Coccidiosis?", "answer": "It is likely sick with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). A Healthy bird will have a full, rounded crop after spending time near a feeder. Coccidiosis causes such severe abdominal pain and nausea that the bird loses its appetite (anorexia) and remains empty even when food is available. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between a bird 'star-gazing' due to Newcastle and a bird with a drooping head from Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) 'star-gazing' involves a neurological spasm where the head is pulled back toward the tail. In Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng), the head simply droops forward or is tucked into the feathers because the bird is too weak to hold its neck up, but there are no involuntary spasms. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Salmonella cause the same 'hunched ball' posture that is so common in Coccidiosis outbreaks?", "answer": "Yes, both can cause a hunched posture, but look at the vent. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) will almost always show a dry, chalky white 'pasty vent' that blocks the exit. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes a hunched posture due to intestinal cramping, and the vent will be stained with blood or orange mucus, not a hard white crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Chronic (CRD) from Coccidiosis by looking at the bird's eyes and face?", "answer": "Absolutely. Chronic (CRD) causes facial swelling, wet eyes, and often foamy bubbles in the corners of the eyelids. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) eyes remain clear and dry, though the skin around the eyes and the comb will become very pale pink or white. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I see dark, irregular scabs on the bird's wattles, is it a sign of anemia from Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Dark, irregular, wart-like scabs are the primary sign of Fowlpox (Đậu gà). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) anemia results in a loss of color, making the wattles look smooth and very pale, but it never causes raised scabs or lesions. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the gait of a bird with Bumblefoot differ from the way a Coccidiosis bird moves?", "answer": "A bird with Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) will limp on one specific leg and avoid putting weight on its footpad due to a visible black scab. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) doesn't limp on one side; it staggers on both legs because it is dizzy and weak from internal blood loss. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If the scales on the bird's legs are smooth but the legs are as white as paper, is it Scaly Leg Mites or Coccidiosis?", "answer": "It is Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) would make the scales rough, thick, and erupted. Paper-white, smooth legs are a sign of severe anemia, which is a hallmark of a heavy Coccidiosis parasite load. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can a rooster's Spurs get so long that they make him look as lethargic as a bird with Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Long Spurs (Cựa) can make a rooster walk clumsily, but they won't make him lethargic. A rooster with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) will stop crowing, stop eating, and show a total lack of spirit, whereas a bird with just long spurs will still be active and vocal. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Coccidiosis feel colder to the touch than a Healthy bird?", "answer": "A Healthy bird has a high metabolic rate and strong blood circulation, keeping its body and comb warm. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes severe internal bleeding and anemia, which lowers the bird's body temperature and makes its extremities (comb, feet) feel cold. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my flock is dying rapidly and many have green droppings and twisted necks, is Coccidiosis the likely cause?", "answer": "No. Rapid death with twisted necks and bright green droppings points toward Newcastle (NCD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is a slower disease where birds waste away and pass blood or orange-tinted droppings for several days before succumbing. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has sunken, dull eyes and is unresponsive, how can I tell if it's Coccidiosis or just a Healthy bird sleeping deeply?", "answer": "A Healthy bird's eyes are round, bright, and clear; even when sleeping, they snap open at the slightest noise. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) has sunken, 'tired' looking eyes that stay half-closed even when you handle the bird, indicating severe internal distress and dehydration. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the leg paralysis seen in some Newcastle cases look like the weakness caused by Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. Newcastle (NCD) can cause actual nerve paralysis where a leg is dragged or stuck in an odd position. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes extreme weakness due to anemia, making the bird stagger or sit down frequently, but the legs are not paralyzed and can still move if the bird is forced. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a chick have blood-stained fluff around its vent instead of the hard white 'plug' of Salmonella?", "answer": "Blood-stained or orange-tinted fluff is a sign of Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causing intestinal hemorrhaging. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a chalky, liquid white diarrhea that dries into a hard, cement-like 'plug' (pasty vent) which is absent in Coccidiosis. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is thin and growing slowly but has no 'khẹc' (gasping) sounds, is it more likely Chronic (CRD) or Coccidiosis?", "answer": "It is more likely Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). Chronic (CRD) almost always presents with respiratory sounds like rattling, sneezing, or 'khẹc'.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the extremely pale wattles of a Coccidiosis bird be confused with the yellow pustules of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes the wattles to lose their red color and become smooth and pale pink or white. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) creates raised, yellowish pustules or dark, bumpy scabs on the surface of the wattles and comb. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the reason for not perching differ between a bird with Bumblefoot and one with Coccidiosis?", "answer": "A bird with Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) refuses to perch because the physical pressure on its footpad is painful due to a black-centered abscess. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) stays on the ground because it is too exhausted and weak to fly or balance on a perch. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Could the white, flour-like dust on a bird's legs be a sign of Coccidiosis anemia?", "answer": "No. White, flour-like dust or thick crusts on the legs are caused by Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes the legs to appear pale and 'bloodless' under the skin, but the surface of the leg scales remains clean and smooth. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster is still crowing and mating but has a very large Spur, does he have Coccidiosis?", "answer": "No. If he is active, crowing, and mating, he is Healthy. A large Spur (Cựa) is a normal part of his anatomy.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the water intake of a bird with Coccidiosis compare to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "A Healthy bird drinks regularly but moderately. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) may either stop drinking entirely due to severe lethargy or, in some stages, drink excessively to compensate for the fluid loss from diarrhea, leading to a very 'watery' crop. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) is often called a 'thief in the night' because it causes sudden, massive mortality with neurological signs.

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird stops scratching the ground and just stands in one spot, is it just a Healthy bird resting or a sign of Coccidiosis?", "answer": "A Healthy bird will scratch and peck almost constantly while awake. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) loses the instinct to forage; it will stand hunched in one spot for hours, showing no interest in scratching the dirt or searching for food. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if my bird's heavy breathing is from the pain of Coccidiosis or the respiratory distress of Newcastle?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) causes gasping with an open beak and a distinct 'khẹc' sound. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes shallow, rapid breathing due to internal pain and anemia, but the bird's beak usually remains closed and there is no rattling sound in the throat. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a chick with Coccidiosis have 'watery' orange droppings instead of the dry, white paste of Salmonella?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) damages the intestinal wall, releasing blood and mucus that makes droppings wet and orange/red. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) involves a systemic infection that results in an excess of white urates, which dry quickly into a hard, plaster-like paste. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I see a bird with a dirty face and wet nostrils, should I worry about Coccidiosis or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "Wet nostrils and a 'dirty' face from dust sticking to nasal discharge are classic signs of Chronic (CRD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is a digestive disease; the bird's face may be pale, but it will always be dry and free of respiratory discharge. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the pale, almost white comb of a bird with Coccidiosis different from the scabby comb of a bird with Fowlpox?", "answer": "Yes. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes a total loss of color (anemia), making the comb look smooth and white like paper.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can a rooster with a very large Spur still be considered Healthy if he is slightly slow to move?", "answer": "Yes. A large Spur (Cựa) can make a rooster's gait look awkward. However, if his comb is bright red and he is still alert and vocal, he is Healthy.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird's weight loss is due to Coccidiosis or if it is just a naturally thin, Healthy breed?", "answer": "A naturally thin Healthy bird will have a firm breast muscle and be very active. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) will have a very prominent, 'sharp' breastbone (keel bone) because it is wasting away, and it will be very sluggish. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is found dead with its head tucked under its body, is this more typical of Newcastle or Coccidiosis?", "answer": "This posture is often seen in Newcastle (NCD) due to neurological spasms before death.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the coldness of a bird's legs a reliable way to tell Coccidiosis apart from a Healthy bird?", "answer": "Yes. A Healthy bird has warm legs and feet due to active blood flow.
