{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a swollen foot and is gasping with its head extended, is it Bumblefoot?", "answer": "No. The swollen foot is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), but the 'air hunger' (gasping with an extended neck) is a symptom of a severe respiratory blockage, likely from 'Wet Pox' or Newcastle (NCD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the yellow, 'cheesy' pus inside a Bumblefoot scab the same as the pus in an eye from Coryza?", "answer": "They are both types of 'cheesy' pus (fibrinous exudate), but they are caused by different infections. In Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), the pus is trapped in the foot. In Coryza, it is trapped in the facial sinuses. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Infectious Coryza, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Bumblefoot cause a bird's feathers to become dull and messy like a Healthy bird in molt?", "answer": "Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) makes the bird too sore to move and preen properly, which can make feathers look messy. However, molting (thay lông) involves feathers actually falling out and being replaced, which is a natural Healthy process. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a single black scab on its foot and is still eating well, is it considered Healthy?", "answer": "No. Even if the bird is eating, a black scab on the footpad indicates a chronic infection (Bumblefoot).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a hard, dark scab on its foot and spends all day sitting on its hocks, is it simply 'Lazy'?", "answer": "No. A Healthy bird is naturally active and alert. Sitting on the hocks (khuỵu gối) is a sign of severe pain or weakness. If there is a black scab on the foot, the bird is sitting to avoid the intense pressure of Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Bumblefoot cause the toes to curl inward permanently like a 'fist'?", "answer": "No. Permanently curled toes are usually a sign of a Vitamin B2 deficiency or a nerve issue.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does Bumblefoot often affect the largest, heaviest rooster in the flock?", "answer": "Weight is a major factor. The heavier the bird, the more pressure is put on the footpads when walking or jumping. This pressure can cause micro-cracks where bacteria enter, leading to Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a swollen foot and is shaking its head frequently, what are the two likely causes?", "answer": "The swollen foot is a sign of Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), and the head-shaking is a sign of respiratory irritation, likely from Chronic (CRD) or Infectious Coryza. They are two separate issues. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a hard, thickened pad but no black scab yet, is it just a 'callus' or is it Bumblefoot?", "answer": "In a Healthy bird, the footpad is tough but flexible. A hard, thickened pad that is red or hot is the beginning of Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). A callus doesn't cause pain or heat; if the bird is limping, it is an infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird's leg dragging is from Bumblefoot or Marek’s Disease?", "answer": "Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) causes a limp because of a painful scab on the footpad.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a Healthy bird's foot feel smooth, while a Bumblefoot foot feels 'cracked' or 'rough'?", "answer": "A Healthy footpad has intact skin that acts as a barrier. Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) begins when that barrier is broken by rough floors or thorns, leading to inflammation that makes the skin look stretched, cracked, and angry. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is standing with one foot held up into its belly feathers, is it just resting?", "answer": "Healthy birds do this to stay warm, but they should switch feet. if a bird consistently hides the same foot and limps when it puts it down, it likely has a painful Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Bumblefoot from Gapeworm by looking at the bird's posture?", "answer": "Yes. Gapeworm causes 'gaping' (stretching the neck to breathe). Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) causes the bird to shift its weight or sit down frequently. One is a breathing struggle; the other is a walking struggle. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Gapeworm, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Bumblefoot cause the same 'khẹc' or 'snicking' sound as Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) is a physical infection of the foot.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the smell of a Healthy coop differ from one where birds have severe Bumblefoot?", "answer": "A Healthy coop smells like dry wood or straw. If many birds have open, draining Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) sores, there may be a faint 'decaying' or foul smell from the infected pus, though it's not as strong as Coryza. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If the footpad is yellow and firm, but not swollen or hot, is it Bumblefoot?", "answer": "Probably not. Some breeds naturally have yellow, firm pads.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a bird with Bumblefoot less likely to jump for treats than a Healthy bird?", "answer": "Jumping puts intense, sharp pressure on the footpad. Because Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) is a deep-tissue abscess, the impact is extremely painful. A Healthy bird will jump and land without any hesitation or sign of pain. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Bumblefoot cause the toes to become stiff and unbendable?", "answer": "Yes.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I tell if a bird has Bumblefoot by looking at its roosting bar?", "answer": "Sometimes. If the roosting bar is very narrow or sharp, it can cause the injuries that lead to Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). Healthy birds need a wide, smooth roosting surface to prevent footpad pressure and infections. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Bumblefoot cause the comb to turn bright purple like Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. A purple comb (cyanosis) means the bird isn't getting enough oxygen, which is common in Newcastle (NCD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has one swollen foot and one normal foot, is it more likely to be a systemic disease or Bumblefoot?", "answer": "It is likely Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). Systemic diseases (like Newcastle) usually affect both legs or the whole body. Bumblefoot often starts in one foot where a specific injury occurred, making that foot look much larger than the Healthy one. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the 'black scab' in Bumblefoot so hard to remove compared to a Healthy scab?", "answer": "A Healthy scab sits on top of the skin. The black scab in Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) is actually a 'plug' of dead tissue that goes deep into the footpad. It is rooted in a pocket of pus, making it feel like a solid part of the foot. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Bumblefoot, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a hard, black scab on its footpad and the whole foot feels significantly hotter than the other leg, is it Healthy?", "answer": "No. Heat is a primary indicator of an active infection.
