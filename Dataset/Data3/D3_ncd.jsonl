{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a rooster with a long Spur show the same drooping wings as a rooster with Newcastle?", "answer": "No. A rooster with a long Spur (Cựa) remains healthy, alert, and keeps his wings tucked. NCD causes drooping wings because the bird is too weak and systemically ill. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Compare the breathing of a healthy bird to one with Newcastle.", "answer": "Healthy birds breathe quietly with closed beaks. NCD-infected birds gasp loudly (khẹc), stretching their necks out and opening their beaks wide (beak gaping) to get air. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do the egg shells of a hen with Chronic (CRD) compare to those with Newcastle?", "answer": "CRD might slightly reduce production, but NCD makes eggs sandpaper-rough, severely misshapen, or completely white and bleached overnight. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If the droppings are bright green and watery, is it Salmonella or Newcastle?", "answer": "Bright green and watery droppings are a primary sign of Newcastle (NCD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is characterized by thick, pasty, and purely white droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird is 'rù' from Newcastle or just a healthy bird sleeping after a meal?", "answer": "A healthy sleeping bird wakes up and becomes active the moment it hears food or movement. A bird with Newcastle 'rù' remains in a deep, lethargic stupor, often with its head tucked under its wing or hanging down. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the watery green diarrhea of Newcastle different from the loose droppings in Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Yes. NCD diarrhea is watery, foul-smelling, and bright green. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) droppings are typically thick, containing blood or looking like orange/brown mucus, and do not cause the bird to gasp for air. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Compare the head movements: Newcastle vs. a healthy bird looking for a mate.", "answer": "A healthy bird has sharp, purposeful, and coordinated head movements. A bird with NCD shows 'star-gazing' or twisted neck (torticollis), where the head turns uncontrollably in circles or upside down due to nerve damage. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the facial appearance of a bird with Chronic (CRD) differ from one with Newcastle?", "answer": "Chronic (CRD) often causes 'owl head' swelling where the sinuses around the eyes puff up with fluid. In NCD, the face usually looks normal, but the bird's beak is often open as it gasps for air (khẹc). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Newcastle from Fowlpox by looking at the bird's skin?", "answer": "Yes. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) creates visible scabs, crusts, or wart-like growths on the unfeathered parts of the head and legs. Newcastle (NCD) is a systemic virus that leaves the skin looking normal while attacking internal organs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How is the leg dragging in Newcastle different from a bird with a Bumblefoot injury?", "answer": "In NCD, the leg is dragged because it is paralyzed (limp or curled toes). In Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), the bird limps or avoids putting weight on the foot because of a painful, hot swelling and a visible black scab on the sole. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Newcastle cause the same slow decline as Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. Newcastle (NCD) is an acute disease that can kill a bird in 24-48 hours. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is a chronic parasitic infestation that takes months to cause the scales on the legs to become thick and crusty. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster is tripping, how do I know if it's because of a long Spur or Newcastle?", "answer": "A rooster with a long Spur (Cựa) will physically trip but remain very alert, aggressive, and have a good appetite. A rooster with NCD will be extremely weak, show drooping wings, and have green diarrhea. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Spur, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Compare the mortality rate of Salmonella in chicks vs. Newcastle in a flock.", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) mostly causes high mortality in very young chicks who show 'pasty vents.' Newcastle (NCD) is a 'killer of all ages,' capable of wiping out an entire flock of adult birds in just a few days. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a bird with a full crop always sick with Newcastle?", "answer": "Not necessarily. A healthy bird has a full crop after eating. However, an NCD-infected bird has a 'sour crop' that stays full of liquid and gas even after a night of rest because the digestive system has stopped working. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird's drooping wings are from Newcastle or if it's just a healthy bird stretching?", "answer": "A healthy bird stretches its wings and then quickly tucks them back against its body. In Newcastle (NCD), the wings droop permanently toward the ground because the bird is too weak or paralyzed to hold them up. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Coccidiosis ever cause the same 'star-gazing' neurological signs as Newcastle?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is an intestinal disease that causes bloody diarrhea and wasting. Neurological signs like 'star-gazing' or a twisted neck are specific indicators of Newcastle (NCD) and are not seen in Coccidiosis. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the difference between the white urates in Newcastle diarrhea and a Salmonella infection?", "answer": "In NCD, white urates are watery and mixed with a large volume of bright green feces. In Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), the droppings are a thick, chalky white paste that often dries into a hard crust around the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the 'khẹc' sound in Chronic (CRD) as life-threatening as the gasping in Newcastle?", "answer": "No. While both cause respiratory sounds, Chronic (CRD) is a long-term illness with low mortality. The gasping (khẹc) in Newcastle (NCD) is an acute symptom that usually leads to death for most of the flock within a few days. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Newcastle from Fowlpox by checking for physical growths on the comb?", "answer": "Yes. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) is characterized by distinct wart-like nodules or dry scabs on the comb and face. Newcastle (NCD) causes no external growths; instead, it causes systemic symptoms like green diarrhea and lethargy. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the foot texture of a bird with Bumblefoot differ from one with Newcastle paralysis?", "answer": "A bird with Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) has a swollen, inflamed footpad with a hard black scab. A bird with Newcastle (NCD) paralysis has a normal, smooth footpad but the leg is limp or the toes are curled. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the timeline of leg issues different between Scaly Leg Mites and Newcastle?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) paralysis happens suddenly, often overnight. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is a slow process where the leg scales gradually become thick, white, and crusty over several weeks or months. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has difficulty walking but is still very aggressive, is it Newcastle or his Spur?", "answer": "It is likely his Spur (Cựa). An overgrown spur physically hinders movement but the rooster remains alert and aggressive. A bird with Newcastle would be extremely weak (rù), lethargic, and non-aggressive. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do the eyes of a healthy bird compare to a bird in the Newcastle 'rù' state?", "answer": "A healthy bird has bright, wide-open, and clear eyes. A bird with Newcastle (NCD) in the 'rù' state has dull, sunken, and half-closed eyes, appearing to be in a deep, unresponsive sleep. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Compare the facial swelling: Newcastle vs. Chronic Respiratory Disease (CRD).", "answer": "Chronic (CRD) is known for causing significant facial and sinus swelling ('owl head'). Newcastle (NCD) rarely causes facial swelling; instead, it is characterized by deep gasping through an open beak. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the mortality pattern of Newcastle (NCD) in adult birds differ from a Salmonella infection?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) causes high, rapid mortality in adult birds with green diarrhea and gasping. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) primarily causes high mortality in young chicks with a characteristic white 'pasty vent' and rarely kills adult birds so quickly. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use comb color to tell if a bird has Newcastle or is Healthy?", "answer": "Yes. A Healthy bird has a vibrant, bright red comb. A bird with Newcastle (NCD) often has a dark purple or bluish comb (cyanosis) due to severe respiratory distress and high fever. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicken is gasping but has no eye bubbles, is it Newcastle or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "It is more likely Newcastle (NCD). Chronic (CRD) is almost always accompanied by foamy bubbles in the eye corners and facial swelling, whereas NCD gasping is 'cleaner' but much more severe and deadly. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What distinguishes the blood-stained droppings of Coccidiosis from the diarrhea of Newcastle?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes droppings containing fresh blood or orange mucus. Newcastle (NCD) produces bright green, watery diarrhea without blood, usually accompanied by neurological signs like a twisted neck. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Newcastle cause the same hard, black 'plug' on the foot as Bumblefoot?", "answer": "No. A hard black plug or scab on the footpad is the primary sign of Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). Newcastle (NCD) causes leg paralysis or limpness, but the bottom of the footpad remains smooth and free of scabs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird's ruffled feathers are from Scaly Leg Mites or Newcastle?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) causes whole-body ruffled feathers along with extreme lethargy (rù) and green diarrhea. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) only affect the legs, making the scales look thick and white while the bird usually stays active. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the 'star-gazing' neck in Newcastle ever seen in a bird with Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. 'Star-gazing' (torticollis) is a neurological symptom specific to Newcastle (NCD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "How does a rooster's behavior with a long Spur differ from one with Newcastle paralysis?", "answer": "A rooster with a long Spur (Cựa) is energetic, aggressive, and eats well but may trip. A rooster with Newcastle (NCD) paralysis is systemically ill, weak, stays in one place with drooping wings, and loses interest in food. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Compare the vocalization of a Healthy chicken to one with Newcastle.", "answer": "A Healthy chicken makes clear, loud chirping or clucking sounds. A bird with Newcastle (NCD) has a hoarse, raspy voice and makes a distinct 'khẹc' sound because its throat is blocked by mucus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a paralyzed wing, is it more likely Newcastle or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "It is Newcastle (NCD). NCD often causes neurological paralysis of the wings or legs. Chronic (CRD) is strictly a respiratory infection that does not cause paralysis or neurological wing drooping. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a hen's sudden stop in egg-laying is due to Newcastle or just a healthy molting period?", "answer": "A healthy molting hen loses feathers but remains alert and eats well. Newcastle (NCD) causes an abrupt stop in laying accompanied by systemic illness, green diarrhea, and eggs that are misshapen or have soft, sandpaper-like shells. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Chronic (CRD) cause the same type of respiratory gasping as Newcastle?", "answer": "They both involve gasping (khẹc), but Chronic (CRD) is typically accompanied by foamy bubbles in the eyes and facial swelling. Newcastle (NCD) gasping is more acute, causing birds to stretch their necks and open their beaks wide with a much higher death rate. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What distinguishes the lethargy in Coccidiosis from the 'rù' state in Newcastle?", "answer": "In Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng), birds look hunched and ruffled but usually have bloody or orange droppings. In NCD 'rù', the bird is nearly unresponsive with drooping wings and watery green diarrhea. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white diarrhea in Salmonella identical to the white urates seen in Newcastle?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) diarrhea is a thick, chalky white paste that glues the vent shut. NCD white discharge is watery and usually mixed with bright green feces, resulting in a soiled but not blocked vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Newcastle, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my bird is gasping but has no scabs on its comb, is it more likely Newcastle or Fowlpox?", "answer": "It is more likely Newcastle (NCD).
