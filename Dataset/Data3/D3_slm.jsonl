{"img_path": null, "question": "How do I distinguish Scaly Leg Mites from a physical scrape or injury on the leg?", "answer": "An injury is usually localized to one spot and shows a red or black scab. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are usually symmetrical, affecting the entire front and sides of both legs with a generalized thickening. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Scaly Leg Mites often have 'bleeding' scales if you try to clean them?", "answer": "The mites burrow into the sensitive tissue under the scales. In a Healthy bird, the scales are a solid barrier. In an infested bird, the scales are loose and the tissue underneath is raw and easily damaged. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has crusty legs and yellow 'cheesy' plaques in its mouth, is it all caused by the mites?", "answer": "No. The leg crust is Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). The yellow plaques in the mouth are a sign of 'Wet' Fowlpox (Đậu gà) or Canker. These are two separate infections occurring at once. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Mites from Gout by looking at the joints of the toes?", "answer": "Yes. Gout (Gút) causes hard, lumpy swelling specifically at the joints (knuckles). Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) cause the entire toe to look thick and 'popcorn-like' without specific lumpy joints. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Gout, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird's legs are covered in mud, how can I tell if it is Healthy or has Mites underneath?", "answer": "A Healthy bird's legs will be smooth and shiny once the mud is washed off with warm water. If the legs remain rough, thick, or white after washing, it is a Scaly Leg Mite (Ghẻ) infestation. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a bird with Scaly Leg Mites more likely to develop Bumblefoot?", "answer": "The irritation from the mites causes the bird to peck at its legs, creating open wounds. These wounds allow bacteria to enter, leading to a secondary Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) infection on the footpad. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Scaly Leg Mites cause the bird to have 'green diarrhea' like Fowl Cholera?", "answer": "No. Green diarrhea is a sign of systemic infection like Fowl Cholera (Tụ huyết trùng). Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are external parasites and do not affect the color or consistency of the droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Fowl Cholera, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has feathered legs (like a Brahma), is it immune to Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. Feathered breeds can still get Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). You must check the unfeathered parts of the toes and shanks. A Healthy feathered bird should have smooth, flat scales beneath the feathers. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the 'white powder' of Mites and the 'white diarrhea' of Salmonella?", "answer": "The 'white powder' of Mites (Ghẻ) is dry, crumbly, and attached to the legs. The 'white diarrhea' of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is liquid or pasty and found around the vent or on the ground. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird's legs are smooth but it is walking with a 'goose-step' (jerking its legs), is it Mites?", "answer": "No. High-stepping or jerky movements are usually neurological symptoms of Marek's Disease or Newcastle (NCD). Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) cause a slow, stiff walk due to the physical thickness of the scales. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Scaly Leg Mites often stop roosting on high bars?", "answer": "Bending the toes to grip a roosting bar is very painful when the scales are thick and crusty. A Healthy bird will easily grip the highest roost, while an infested bird may prefer to sleep on the floor. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Scaly Leg Mites cause the bird to have a 'rotten' smell like Infectious Coryza?", "answer": "No. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) typically do not have a strong odor.

{"img_path": null, "question": "If the scales are falling off and leaving a white, 'chalky' bone-like surface, is it a Healthy molt?", "answer": "No. This is an advanced stage of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). The crust has replaced the Healthy scale tissue. Gà (Chickens) do not molt their leg scales; they should remain permanent and smooth. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird has Mites or Coccidiosis by looking at its general behavior?", "answer": "A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is hunched, pale, and has bloody droppings. A bird with Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is usually alert but moves slowly and pecks at its legs because of the intense itching. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Mites from Vitamin B2 deficiency by checking the shape of the toes?", "answer": "Yes. Vitamin B2 deficiency causes 'curled-toe paralysis' where the toes bend inward like a fist but the skin stays smooth. Mites (Ghẻ) cause the skin to be crusty, but the toes are usually straight. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has crusty legs and is constantly shaking its head, what are the two separate issues?", "answer": "The crusty legs are Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ).

They are not the same disease. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird's leg scales are beginning to flake like dry skin, but there is no white powder or lifting, is it Healthy?", "answer": "Usually, yes. Healthy birds can have dry-looking skin in dusty environments. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are only confirmed when the scales are physically forced *outward* from the leg by a buildup of crusty debris. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Scaly Leg Mites cause the bird's beak to look crusty and deformed like its legs?", "answer": "Yes. This is a variation called 'Scaly Face.' The same mites (Ghẻ) that affect the legs can burrow into the unfeathered skin around the beak and eyes, causing a powdery, white crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Scaly Leg Mites spread through the air like Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are spread by direct physical contact or through shared bedding and roosts. Chronic (CRD) is highly airborne and spreads through sneezing and coughing. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a 'hot' feeling in its leg but the scales are smooth, is it Mites?", "answer": "Unlikely. Heat without crusty scales is usually a sign of an internal infection or a localized abscess like Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) in its early stages. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) always show visible scale deformation. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird has Mites or a 'Slipped Tendon' by looking at its gait?", "answer": "A bird with a Slipped Tendon (Perosis) cannot straighten its leg and often drags it. A bird with Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) can move the leg, but it walks with a slow, gingerly, stiff motion because the thick crust is painful to bend. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white crust on the legs of a bird with Mites the same as the white diarrhea of Salmonella?", "answer": "No. The white buildup from Mites (Ghẻ) is a dry, cement-like crust attached to the legs. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes liquid or pasty white diarrhea that coats the feathers around the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I can easily peel a scale off and it is clean underneath, is it Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. In a Healthy bird, scales are hard to remove. In a bird with Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ), the scales are loose, but the area underneath is filled with a crumbly, white residue and is often raw or bleeding. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a bird with Mites also be sneezing ('khẹc') and have eye discharge?", "answer": "The bird has two different infections. The crusty legs are Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ), and the sneezing and eye bubbles are signs of a respiratory disease like Chronic (CRD) or Infectious Coryza. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Mites from Fowlpox by the texture of the scabs?", "answer": "Yes. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) scabs are dark, wart-like, and raised. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) lesions are light grey or white, powdery, and cause the scales to lift upward. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Scaly Leg Mites cause the bird to have the same 'twisted neck' as Newcastle Disease?", "answer": "No. Mites (Ghẻ) do not affect the brain or nerves. A twisted neck (star-gazing) is a neurological symptom of Newcastle (NCD) or a severe vitamin deficiency. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Scaly Leg Mites lose its appetite compared to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "The constant itching and pain from the mites (Ghẻ) causes chronic stress, which suppresses the bird's desire to eat. A Healthy bird is active, foragers for food, and has a strong appetite. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do I distinguish Scaly Leg Mites from Gout in the toe joints?", "answer": "Gout (Gút) causes lumpy, hard, white nodes under the skin of the joints. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) cause a uniform, crusty 'popcorn' texture that covers the entire toe and shank, lifting the scales. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Gout, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has crusty legs and a very foul smell from its head, is it the mites?", "answer": "No. The crusty legs are Mites (Ghẻ), but a foul 'rotten' smell from the head is a definitive sign of Infectious Coryza (Sưng phù đầu). Mites do not produce a strong odor. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Infectious Coryza, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Mites be detected on a Healthy-looking bird that is in the same cage as an infested bird?", "answer": "Yes, but only under a microscope or by looking for very early scale lifting. Because Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) are highly contagious, any bird near an infested one is likely at risk even if they look Healthy today. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Scaly Leg Mites cause the same green droppings as Fowl Cholera?", "answer": "No. Green diarrhea is a sign of a systemic infection like Fowl Cholera (Tụ huyết trùng).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has smooth scales on its shanks but a black scab on its footpad, is it Mites?", "answer": "No. Smooth shanks indicate no Mites (Ghẻ). A black scab on the footpad is a classic sign of Bumblefoot (Lậu đế), which is a bacterial infection of the tissue. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the skin of a bird with Mites often red and raw under the white crust?", "answer": "The mites (Ghẻ) burrow into the live tissue to feed, causing inflammation and bleeding. In a Healthy bird, the scales provide a protective, dry barrier that prevents the skin from becoming raw. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I tell if a bird has Mites or Coccidiosis by checking for blood?", "answer": "Yes. Mites (Ghẻ) may cause small drops of blood on the legs. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes significant amounts of blood in the droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does a bird with Scaly Leg Mites have 'bubbly eyes' like a bird with CRD?", "answer": "No. Mites (Ghẻ) do not cause respiratory symptoms.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a Healthy bird walk with its toes spread, while a bird with Mites might walk 'stiff-toed'?", "answer": "A Healthy bird has full flexibility in its joints. A bird with Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) has legs that are 'encased' in a hard, brittle crust, making it physically difficult and painful to spread its toes naturally. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has white, powdery crusts around its beak and eyelids but its legs are smooth, is it Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "Unlikely. While the same mites (Ghẻ) can cause 'Scaly Face,' it almost always starts on the legs first. A crusty face with smooth legs is more likely Fowlpox (Đậu gà) or a fungal infection like Favus. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between a bird with Mites and a bird with Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) deficiency?", "answer": "Vitamin B2 deficiency causes 'curled-toe paralysis' where the toes bend inward, but the scales remain smooth and Healthy.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Scaly Leg Mites be distinguished from Marek's Disease by checking the bird's grip?", "answer": "Yes. A bird with Mites (Ghẻ) can still grip a perch, though it is painful and stiff. A bird with Marek's Disease often loses the nerve ability to grip entirely, resulting in a 'floppy' or paralyzed foot. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Scaly Leg Mites often have 'dirty' wing feathers compared to a Healthy bird?", "answer": "Because the legs are so painful, the bird cannot stand properly to preen its wings.

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird's leg is swollen and red between the scales, but there is no white crust yet, is it Healthy?", "answer": "No. This is the inflammatory stage of Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). The mites are active and burrowing, causing the tissue to swell before the visible crust builds up. A Healthy leg is never red or swollen. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Scaly Leg Mites, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I distinguish Mites from Newcastle by observing if the bird can lift its head?", "answer": "Yes. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) only affect the skin.
