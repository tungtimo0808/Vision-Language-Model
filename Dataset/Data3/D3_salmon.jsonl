{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is isolating itself from the flock, how can I distinguish between a healthy bird taking a dust bath and one suffering from Coccidiosis depression?", "answer": "A healthy bird in a dust bath is active, flapping wings, and stays alert to its surroundings. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) isolates itself by standing or sitting motionless, with eyes closed, ruffled feathers, and shows no interest in social activities. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the foul-smelling, bloody diarrhea of Coccidiosis ever occur in a bird with a simple Salmonella infection?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is typically associated with a non-bloody, chalky white liquid diarrhea that dries into a hard paste. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) is unique for causing significant intestinal bleeding, resulting in bright red, orange, or chocolate-colored stools. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Salmonella, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "When observing a bird with drooping wings, what signs point toward Newcastle rather than the systemic weakness of Coccidiosis?", "answer": "While both cause weakness, Newcastle (NCD) drooping is usually accompanied by a twisted neck, star-gazing, or loud gasping (khẹc). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes drooping wings purely due to exhaustion and anemia, always paired with a very pale comb and bloody droppings. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I rule out Coccidiosis if my bird is coughing and has swollen sinuses, even if it looks thin?", "answer": "Yes. Coughing, rattling sounds (khẹc), and facial swelling are definitive signs of Chronic (CRD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) only affects the gut and does not cause any fluid buildup in the eyes or respiratory distress. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the shrunken, pale pink comb of a Coccidiosis bird easily confused with the dark, crusty scabs of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes the comb to lose color entirely, becoming smooth and almost white.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the location of the pain differ between a bird with Bumblefoot and one with Coccidiosis?", "answer": "A bird with Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) has localized pain in its foot, visible as a hot, black-centered swelling. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes general abdominal pain and systemic cramping, leading the bird to hunch its entire body into a 'ball' shape. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Could the slow movement of my chicken be caused by the thick, white leg scales of Scaly Leg Mites instead of Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Yes. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) cause physical stiffness in the legs due to thick, crusty buildup. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes slow movement because the bird is too weak and anemic to walk, but its leg scales will remain smooth and normal-looking. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a rooster's lack of spirit is due to his heavy Spurs or an underlying Coccidiosis infection?", "answer": "A healthy rooster with large Spurs (Cựa) will still try to crow, defend his hens, and eat vigorously. A rooster with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) will be completely listless, stop crowing, and lose his appetite entirely as his body wastes away. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the difference in comb temperature between a healthy bird and one with a severe Coccidiosis burden?", "answer": "A healthy bird has a warm, bright red comb due to good blood circulation. A bird with Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) has a cold, pale comb because it is suffering from severe internal blood loss and poor circulation (anemia). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If several birds in the flock are dying within 24 hours, is it more likely an acute Newcastle outbreak or Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Very rapid, mass mortality with nervous signs is typical of Newcastle (NCD). Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) usually presents a slower progression where you will see birds getting thinner, looking 'rù' (lethargic), and passing bloody stools for a few days before they start dying. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Coccidiosis, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does my chick have a swollen, hot wing joint? Is it an injury from a long Spur or a symptom of Salmonella?", "answer": "A long Spur (Cựa) only affects adult roosters and doesn't cause joint swelling.

{"img_path": null, "question": "A healthy bird's vent is clean and pink. How does this compare to a bird with an acute Salmonella infection?", "answer": "A healthy bird has no fecal matter sticking to its vent feathers.

The 'star-gazing' position (head twisted back) is a neurological symptom specific to Newcastle (NCD). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are running around and jumping over each other, are they likely Healthy or showing early signs of Salmonella?", "answer": "They are Healthy. High energy, playful behavior, and 'running' are signs of vitality. Chicks with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) are the opposite; they are listless, reluctant to move, and often stand in one place with their heads tucked into their chests. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish between the watery green droppings of Newcastle Disease and the thick white droppings of Salmonella?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) produces thin, watery, bright green droppings that look like bile. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a thick, creamy, or chalky white diarrhea that sticks to the feathers and dries into a hard crust around the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is a 5-day-old chick with white diarrhea more likely to have Salmonella than Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) usually takes 2-3 weeks of exposure to build up in the gut, so it rarely affects chicks under 15 days old. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is often passed from the mother to the egg, leading to white diarrhea and high mortality in the very first week of life. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has white fecal stains on its vent but its face is swollen and eyes are bubbly, is it Salmonella or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "The swollen face and bubbly eyes are definitive signs of Chronic (CRD). While Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes white diarrhea, it does not cause the severe upper respiratory swelling and 'foamy' eyes characteristic of CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Are the dark, bumpy scabs on a chicken's comb a sign that a Salmonella infection is getting worse?", "answer": "No. Dark, raised, wart-like scabs on the comb or face are signs of Fowlpox (Đậu gà). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is an internal infection that shows externally as white, chalky diarrhea on the vent, not as scabs on the head. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird is sitting down because of a Bumblefoot infection instead of Salmonella weakness?", "answer": "Pick up the bird and look at the bottom of its feet. If you see a hot, swollen pad with a black 'plug' or scab, it is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). If the feet are clean but the vent is caked in white paste and the bird is very weak, it is Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the white, flour-like crust on a bird's legs mean the bird has Salmonella?", "answer": "No. White, crusty, and raised scales on the legs are caused by Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has a very long, sharp Spur and a bright red comb, is he a Healthy bird?", "answer": "Yes. A bright red comb, active behavior, and a large Spur (Cựa) are typical for a Healthy adult rooster. If he had Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), his comb would likely be pale or shrunken, and he would be very lethargic despite his spurs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do chicks with Salmonella often look 'pot-bellied' while their wings droop?", "answer": "The 'pot-bellied' look in Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is often due to an unabsorbed yolk sac or internal inflammation. This systemic infection makes the chick so weak that it cannot hold its wings against its body, causing them to droop toward the floor. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If half my chicks died overnight with their necks twisted, is it a Salmonella outbreak?", "answer": "No. Sudden high mortality combined with twisted necks (star-gazing) is a hallmark of Newcastle (NCD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) kills chicks more slowly, usually preceded by several days of huddling and white 'pasty vent' symptoms. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are chirping softly and moving around the brooder, are they Healthy or showing symptoms of Salmonella?", "answer": "They are Healthy. Soft, intermittent chirping and active movement are signs of contentment. Chicks with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) emit loud, persistent, and 'piercing' chirps because they are in pain and feel cold due to the infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if the white on a bird's droppings is just normal urates or a sign of Salmonella?", "answer": "Normal Healthy droppings are firm with a small, dry white cap of urates. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes the entire stool to be a liquid or pasty white material that smears across the vent and feathers, eventually drying into a thick, chalky crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is the diarrhea in Newcastle Disease bright green while Salmonella is chalky white?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) causes systemic failure that leads to an excess of bile being excreted, resulting in green droppings. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) specifically causes an excess of urates and intestinal inflammation, producing its signature white, chalky diarrhea. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a dirty vent but is making a 'khẹc' rattling sound in its throat, is it Salmonella or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "The 'khẹc' rattling sound and any nasal discharge are definitive for Chronic (CRD). While Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes a dirty, pasty vent, it does not involve the upper respiratory system or cause the throat rattling seen in CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the white paste on a chick's tail feathers be confused with the scabs from Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) paste is white, soft (when fresh), and located only around the vent. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) produces hard, raised, dark brown or black scabs on the comb, wattles, and face, never as a white smear on the tail. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is reluctant to walk and is wobbly, how do I know it’s not Bumblefoot?", "answer": "Check the bottom of the feet; Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) presents as a hot, swollen pad with a central black scab. A Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) bird is wobbly because of general weakness and will have a white-stained vent, but its footpads will be smooth and normal. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does the white, crusty appearance of Scaly Leg Mites mean the bird has a Salmonella infection in its legs?", "answer": "No. Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) cause white, powdery crusts specifically under the leg scales, making them lift.

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has very long Spurs and a bright red comb, can he still be a carrier of Salmonella?", "answer": "Yes. A rooster can look perfectly Healthy and have impressive Spurs (Cựa) while being a chronic carrier of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). He can pass the bacteria in his droppings to the environment or to hens, which then produce infected eggs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do the eyes of a chick with Salmonella look sunken compared to a Healthy chick?", "answer": "A Healthy chick has bright, round, prominent eyes. A chick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) becomes severely dehydrated due to diarrhea and systemic infection, causing the eyes to look sunken into the head and often half-closed. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are dying in a 'huddled ball' posture with white vents, is it likely Newcastle?", "answer": "No. Dying in a huddled ball with white 'pasty vents' is the classic mortality pattern for Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Newcastle (NCD) mortality is usually preceded by more violent neurological signs like twisted necks or paralysis. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If some chicks in a batch are half the size of others and have ruffled feathers, are they just a different Healthy breed?", "answer": "Probably not. Stunted growth and ruffled ('staring') feathers are major signs of a Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) infection in the first weeks of life. Healthy chicks of the same age should be uniform in size and have smooth, sleek down or feathers. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the white urates in a Newcastle dropping and the white diarrhea of Salmonella?", "answer": "In Newcastle (NCD), the white is usually just a small part of a very watery, bright green dropping. In Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), the entire dropping is a thick, chalky, or creamy white liquid that coats the vent and dries into a solid white mass. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a bird with Salmonella have a 'pasty vent' while a bird with Coccidiosis usually does not?", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes a systemic infection that results in thick, white urate-heavy diarrhea that sticks to the feathers and blocks the vent. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) causes intestinal bleeding, resulting in liquid red or orange droppings that are usually too fluid to form a hard white crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicken has a clean face but is passing white liquid stool, is it more likely Chronic (CRD) or Salmonella?", "answer": "It is more likely Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Chronic (CRD) is identified by respiratory discharge that stains the face and bubbles in the eyes. Salmonella primarily affects the digestive tract and system, leaving the face dry but the vent area messy and white. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Could the white, chalky residue on a bird's tail be an early stage of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. White residue on the tail feathers is dried diarrhea from Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Fowlpox (Đậu gà) manifests as physical skin lesions—yellowish bumps or dark brown scabs—specifically on the unfeathered parts of the head and comb. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is sitting on its hocks and won't stand up, how can I rule out Bumblefoot?", "answer": "Examine the bottom of the feet. If there is no swelling and no black scab, it isn't Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). A bird sitting on its hocks with a white-stained vent and general weakness is suffering from a systemic infection like Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Are the raised, crusty scales on a bird's legs a sign of an advanced Salmonella infection?", "answer": "No. Raised, thick, and crusty scales are caused by Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) affects the bird internally and through its droppings, but it does not cause the leg scales to lift or become crusty. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can a rooster with a very long Spur be Healthy if he is also a 'carrier' of Salmonella?", "answer": "Yes. An adult rooster can be a 'silent carrier' of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), meaning he looks Healthy and has strong Spurs (Cựa), but he still sheds the bacteria in his droppings which can then infect the rest of the flock or his offspring. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do Healthy chicks move away when you reach for them, while Salmonella chicks often stay still?", "answer": "Healthy chicks have a strong survival instinct and high energy. Chicks with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) are so weakened by the infection and dehydration that they lose their flight response and will often allow themselves to be picked up without struggling. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are dying rapidly and showing 'star-gazing' (head back) symptoms, is it Salmonella?", "answer": "No. 'Star-gazing' or a twisted neck is a neurological symptom of Newcastle (NCD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes high mortality, but the chicks typically die in a slumped or huddled position with white, pasty vents, not with twisted necks. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a Healthy chick drinks water frequently, how does its behavior differ from a chick with Salmonella?", "answer": "A Healthy chick drinks quickly and returns to active play or eating. A chick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) may stand over the waterer with its head drooping, appearing to want to drink but often being too weak or uncoordinated to swallow effectively. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish the white diarrhea of Salmonella from the watery green droppings of Newcastle Disease in a brooder?", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) creates thick, chalky white spots on the floor that dry into hard, raised patches. Newcastle (NCD) droppings are thin, watery, and bright green, often soaking into the bedding rather than forming a hard white crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is it unlikely for 3-day-old chicks with white diarrhea to have Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) has an incubation period of at least 4-7 days and requires environmental buildup, usually affecting birds 3 weeks or older. White diarrhea in 3-day-old chicks is almost always Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), often transmitted via the egg. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my birds have white-stained vents but are breathing silently, is it Chronic (CRD) or Salmonella?", "answer": "It is more likely Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Chronic (CRD) is characterized by distinct respiratory noises like 'khẹc' (gasping) or rattling in the throat. Salmonella birds are very weak and lethargic, but their breathing usually remains quiet. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does Salmonella cause the same dark, crusty scabs on the face that I see in Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes a white, pasty buildup around the vent. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) causes dark, raised, wart-like nodules specifically on the unfeathered skin of the face, comb, and wattles, which are never seen in Salmonella. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird is sitting down because of a Bumblefoot infection instead of Salmonella?", "answer": "Feel the bird's feet. Bumblefoot (Lậu đế) causes a hot, swollen footpad with a visible black scab. A bird with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) will have cold or normal-temperature feet and will sit due to general exhaustion and a heavy, pasty vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white, chalky material on a bird's tail the same as the white crust of Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. The white on the tail in Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is dried fecal matter. The white crust in Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is a powdery, hard buildup found specifically under and between the scales of the legs, causing them to bulge. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has long, sharp Spurs but a very pale, shrunken comb, is he Healthy?", "answer": "No. While long Spurs (Cựa) are a normal trait, a pale and shrunken comb is a sign of illness. If he also has white, chalky diarrhea, he is likely suffering from a chronic Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) infection despite his impressive spurs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do chicks with Salmonella often have a 'pot-belly' compared to the slender body of a Healthy chick?", "answer": "Healthy chicks absorb their yolk sacs quickly and have streamlined bodies. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) often prevents the yolk sac from being absorbed, leading to internal infection and a swollen, 'pot-bellied' appearance in the abdomen. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird dies with its legs stretched out behind it and its neck twisted, is it Salmonella?", "answer": "No. This specific posture—neck twisting (star-gazing) and leg paralysis—is a definitive neurological sign of Newcastle (NCD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) victims usually die in a hunched, 'sleeping' position with white diarrhea stains. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a chick is huddled in a corner and refuses to move even when others are eating, is it likely Healthy or sick with Salmonella?", "answer": "It is likely sick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Healthy chicks are highly competitive and will join the group to eat. A chick with Salmonella is often too weak and in too much internal pain to compete for food, leading to isolation and huddling. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does the 'pasty vent' of Salmonella affect the bird's ability to pass waste compared to Newcastle?", "answer": "In Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), the white diarrhea is so thick it often dries and physically seals the vent shut (pasty vent). In Newcastle (NCD), the green diarrhea is very watery and flows easily, so while the feathers may be stained green, the vent is rarely physically blocked by a hard crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a 10-day-old chick with white diarrhea be suspected of Salmonella rather than Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is a primary cause of white diarrhea and death in chicks under 2 weeks old. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) usually requires a longer period for the parasite to cycle in the environment, typically affecting birds that are at least 3 to 6 weeks old and causing bloody stools. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the rattling sound in a bird's chest (khẹc) be a symptom of a systemic Salmonella infection?", "answer": "No. A rattling sound in the chest or throat (khẹc) is a classic respiratory sign of Chronic (CRD) or Newcastle.

A rooster with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) would be weak, have a pale comb, and likely show chronic white diarrhea. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do chicks with Salmonella have 'rough' or 'staring' down compared to Healthy chicks?", "answer": "Healthy chicks have smooth, fluffy, and clean down. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes the chick to stop preening and huddle due to fever, which, combined with the messy white diarrhea, makes the down look wet, matted, and 'staring' (standing up). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is gasping ('khẹc') and also has white diarrhea, is it definitely Salmonella?", "answer": "Not necessarily. Gasping ('khẹc') is a primary sign of Newcastle (NCD) or Chronic (CRD). While Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes white diarrhea, it rarely causes the respiratory gasping sounds; you may be seeing a dual infection or a primary respiratory disease. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a chick is the first to reach the feeder and eats vigorously, is it Healthy or showing signs of Salmonella?", "answer": "It is Healthy. A strong appetite and quick movement are signs of vitality. A chick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) will be disinterested in food, standing near the feeder but not eating, or huddled away from the group entirely. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish between the green-stained feathers of Newcastle and the white-stained feathers of Salmonella?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) results in watery, bright green diarrhea that stains the feathers around the vent a yellowish-green. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) results in a thick, chalky white paste that turns the feathers pure white and eventually dries into a hard crust. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why would a 6-week-old bird with bloody droppings be diagnosed with Coccidiosis instead of Salmonella?", "answer": "At 6 weeks, the presence of blood or orange mucus is a definitive indicator of Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) primarily causes white, chalky diarrhea and is most fatal in much younger chicks (under 3 weeks). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has bubbles in its eyes and a wet beak, is this a symptom of Salmonella?", "answer": "No. Bubbly eyes, nasal discharge, and a wet beak are respiratory signs of Chronic (CRD). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is a systemic and digestive infection; the bird's face will remain dry, though it will look pale and dehydrated. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Are the raised, dark scabs on a bird's wattles related to a Salmonella infection?", "answer": "No. Raised, dark brown or black wart-like scabs on the wattles or comb are the hallmark of Fowlpox (Đậu gà). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) does not cause skin lesions or scabs on the head; its main external sign is white diarrhea on the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird is limping and has a hot, swollen foot with a black center, is it Salmonella or Bumblefoot?", "answer": "It is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes weakness in both legs, making the bird sit or wobble, but it does not cause a localized hot swelling or a black scab on the sole of the foot. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the white, powdery appearance of Scaly Leg Mites be mistaken for the white diarrhea of Salmonella?", "answer": "No. The white in Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ) is a crusty buildup *under* the leg scales, making them look 'exploded' and thick. The white in Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is fecal matter found specifically on the feathers and skin *around* the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has a very long Spur but is still vocal and active, should I worry about Salmonella?", "answer": "No. If the rooster is active, vocal, and has a bright red comb, he is Healthy. A long Spur (Cựa) is a normal physical trait of older roosters. A rooster with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) would be quiet, lethargic, and likely have a pale comb. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do chicks with Salmonella have 'drooping' wings compared to the 'tight' wings of a Healthy chick?", "answer": "Healthy chicks hold their wings tight against their bodies. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes extreme muscular weakness and systemic exhaustion, making it difficult for the chick to support its own weight, which results in the wings drooping toward the ground. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the 'star-gazing' of Newcastle and the 'sleepy head' of Salmonella?", "answer": "In Newcastle (NCD), the 'star-gazing' involves the neck twisting backward or sideways involuntarily. In Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), the 'sleepy head' is simply a drooping posture because the bird is too weak to keep its eyes open or its head up. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a chick is standing at the feeder but just staring at the grain without pecking, is it Healthy or sick with Salmonella?", "answer": "It is likely sick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). While a Healthy chick eats with high energy, a chick with Salmonella often lacks the appetite or strength to peck, resulting in it standing motionless over the food source. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I distinguish between the watery green splashes and the chalky white patches on the brooder floor?", "answer": "Watery green splashes are typical of Newcastle (NCD) and represent bile excretion. Chalky white, thick, or pasty patches that dry into a cement-like texture are the primary sign of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is it unlikely that a 4-day-old chick dying with white diarrhea has Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) requires a cycle of infection that usually takes at least 1-2 weeks in the environment, making it rare in chicks under 14 days old. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) can be transmitted through the egg, causing death and white diarrhea within the first few days of life. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my birds have white-stained tail feathers but show no signs of 'khẹc' (gasping), is it Salmonella or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "It is more likely Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Chronic (CRD) is defined by its respiratory symptoms like gasping, rattling, and bubbly eyes. Salmonella causes the white diarrhea (pasty vent) without affecting the bird's breathing sounds. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the white 'plaster-like' buildup on a chick's vent be a form of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) buildup is dried, white fecal matter. Fowlpox (Đậu gà) produces distinct, raised, dark brown or black wart-like scabs on the comb, face, and wattles, but never a white pasty substance on the vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do I know if a bird is sitting down because of a Bumblefoot scab or Salmonella weakness?", "answer": "Check the soles of the feet for a hot, swollen pad with a black center; this is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). If the feet are normal and cool, and the bird is passing white diarrhea, the sitting is due to the systemic exhaustion of Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white, crusty skin on a bird's legs a sign that it has a severe case of Salmonella?", "answer": "No. Thick, white, and crusty leg scales that appear to be 'lifting' are caused by Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ). Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes white stains only on the feathers and vent due to diarrhea, not on the skin of the legs. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Scaly Leg Mites, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a rooster has a very long, sharp Spur and is still mating with hens, is he a carrier of Salmonella?", "answer": "If he is active and mating, he is Healthy. While any bird can be a carrier, a Healthy rooster with strong Spurs (Cựa) and high energy is less likely to be actively shedding Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) than a weak, lethargic one. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Spur, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why does a Healthy chick have a more 'agile' walk compared to a chick with Salmonella?", "answer": "Healthy chicks are light and quick. Chicks with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) often have a 'stiff' or 'wobbly' gait because they are weak, dehydrated, and may have abdominal pain from an unabsorbed yolk sac or inflamed intestines. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are found dead in a 'sleeping' position with white vents, should I suspect Newcastle?", "answer": "No. Death in a 'sleeping' or 'huddled' position with white diarrhea stains is the classic pattern for Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Newcastle (NCD) deaths are usually preceded by more aggressive signs like twisted necks, tremors, or intense gasping. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If I clap my hands and most chicks scatter but one remains huddled and shivering, is that one Healthy?", "answer": "No. A Healthy chick has a strong startle reflex and will scatter when hearing a loud noise. A chick with Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is often too weak or lethargic to react, remaining huddled and shivering due to systemic infection. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell the difference between the green, watery droppings of Newcastle and the white, pasty droppings of Salmonella?", "answer": "Newcastle (NCD) droppings are thin, watery, and a distinct bright green. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) droppings are thick, chalky white, and have a 'pasty' consistency that dries into a hard crust around the bird's vent. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Newcastle, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is high mortality in the first 7 days of life more indicative of Salmonella than Coccidiosis?", "answer": "Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is often egg-borne, meaning chicks are born infected and die quickly. Coccidiosis (Cầu trùng) requires several days for the parasite to develop in the litter, so it rarely causes death until chicks are at least 3 weeks old. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Coccidiosis, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a very messy, white-stained vent but its eyes are clear and its breathing is silent, is it Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "No. Chronic (CRD) is characterized by bubbly eyes and 'khẹc' (gasping) sounds. If the face is clean but the vent is caked in white paste, the bird is suffering from Salmonella (Bạch lỵ), not CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the white, chalky paste on a chick's tail be an early stage of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. The white paste is dried diarrhea from Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). Fowlpox (Đậu gà) produces raised, dark brown or black wart-like nodules on the face and comb, never a white chalky smear on the feathers. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Fowlpox, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if a bird is sitting on its hocks because of a Bumblefoot scab or Salmonella weakness?", "answer": "Look at the footpad. If there is a hot, swollen pad with a black center, it is Bumblefoot (Lậu đế). If the feet look normal but the bird is weak and has a white-crusted vent, the sitting is due to Salmonella (Bạch lỵ). <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Bumblefoot, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is the white, powdery crust on a bird's legs a sign that Salmonella has spread to the skin?", "answer": "No. A white, powdery, or thick crust on the legs that makes scales lift is caused by Scaly Leg Mites (Ghẻ).

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do chicks with Salmonella look 'pot-bellied' and have ruffled feathers compared to Healthy chicks?", "answer": "The 'pot-belly' in Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) is often due to an unabsorbed yolk sac or internal infection. The ruffled ('staring') feathers occur because the bird is too weak to preen and is huddling to stay warm. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Healthy, distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "If my chicks are dying with their heads twisted back (star-gazing), is this a sign of Salmonella mortality?", "answer": "No. A twisted neck or 'star-gazing' is a neurological sign of Newcastle (NCD).

{"img_path": null, "question": "If a bird has a pasty vent but also shows bubbles in its eyes and a swollen face, is it Salmonella or Chronic (CRD)?", "answer": "The respiratory signs like bubbly eyes and facial swelling are definitive indicators of Chronic (CRD). While Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) causes the pasty vent, it does not cause the upper respiratory swelling seen in CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Salmonella, Chronic (CRD), distinction' </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can the white buildup around the vent in Salmonella be confused with the dark scabs of Fowlpox?", "answer": "No. Salmonella (Bạch lỵ) produces a white, chalky paste.
