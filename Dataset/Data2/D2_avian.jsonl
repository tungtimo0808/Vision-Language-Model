{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "What does the blue-purple discoloration of the comb indicate?", "answer": "The deep cyanosis and edema of the comb and wattles indicate severe systemic hypoxia, a hallmark of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza, making this presentation highly consistent with the disease."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "How do we distinguish this from Newcastle Disease (NCD)?", "answer": "While both cause facial swelling, the intense cyanosis (blue/purple) seen here is more characteristic of Avian Influenza, whereas Newcastle Disease (NCD) is often accompanied by neurological torticollis or forest-green diarrhea."}
{"img_path": "avian_influenza_head/images/ai_head_1.jpg", "question": "Could this be Fowlpox?", "answer": "No, Fowlpox presents with distinct, localized crusty warts.
