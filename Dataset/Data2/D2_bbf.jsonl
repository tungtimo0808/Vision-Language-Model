{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_01.jpg", "question": "Is the hard projection on the foot a Rooster Spur?", "answer": "No. A Spur is a natural bony/keratinized projection located on the inner shank (leg), typically seen in roosters. The lesion in this image is a swollen, inflammatory mass located on the **plantar surface (footpad)**, not the shank. This is soft tissue inflammation, not a bony spur. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_01.jpg", "question": "Do the rough scales indicate Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "Incorrect. Scaly Leg Mites cause the scales on the shank to lift, thicken, and form white, crusty deposits. In this image, the shank scales are relatively flat and normal. The primary pathology is the **ulcerative lesion** on the sole of the foot, which is unrelated to mites. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_01.jpg", "question": "What is the diagnostic significance of the black spot on the footpad?", "answer": "The black spot, or 'scab', is a necrotic plug formed by chronic bacterial infection (usually *Staphylococcus*) and tissue death. It confirms that the swelling is due to Pododermatitis (Bumblefoot) rather than a simple bruise or articular Gout. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_02.jpg", "question": "Is this foot healthy?", "answer": "No. A healthy chicken foot has a soft, pliable, and uniform footpad with no discoloration. This foot exhibits a distinct, dark necrotic scab and surrounding inflammation (redness/swelling), which is pathological. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_02.jpg", "question": "Could this swelling be caused by Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "Unlikely. Mites affect the keratinized scales of the leg, causing them to protrude outwards (hyperkeratosis). This lesion is localized to the soft tissue of the footpad (metatarsal pad). The leg scales above appear unaffected. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_02.jpg", "question": "How do we distinguish this from a natural Spur?", "answer": "Location and texture are key. A Spur is a hard, pointed horn on the shank. This lesion is a flat, dark scab embedded in the soft cushion of the foot. It is an injury site, not an anatomical feature. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_03.jpg", "question": "Is the white crust on the leg a sign of Mites?", "answer": "Visual evidence suggests otherwise. While the foot is dirty, the scales are not raised or 'pine-cone' shaped as seen in Scaly Leg Mites. The defining issue is the swollen pad with a dark central lesion. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_03.jpg", "question": "What indicates this is Bumblefoot and not just a dirty foot?", "answer": "Dirt can be washed off, but the **central black scab (eschar)** seen here is necrotic tissue attached to the wound bed. Furthermore, the surrounding tissue is swollen (edema), indicating an active inflammatory response. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_03.jpg", "question": "Could this localized lump be a Spur?", "answer": "No. Spurs grow from the bone of the leg shaft. This lump is the footpad itself, which is distended due to abscess formation. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_04.jpg", "question": "Is the redness on the foot caused by Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. Mites typically cause pale, chalky white crusts, not bright red inflammation. The redness here (erythema) is due to infection and increased blood flow to the swollen footpad. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_04.jpg", "question": "Is this a normal anatomical variation?", "answer": "No. The footpad is abnormally enlarged and bulbous compared to the toes. A normal footpad is relatively flat. This deformity confirms disease. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_04.jpg", "question": "What confirms the diagnosis of Pododermatitis?", "answer": "The combination of plantar swelling and the presence of a dark, hyperkeratotic scab (the 'bumble') is the definitive visual marker for Pododermatitis. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_05.jpg", "question": "The leg looks rough, is it Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "The leg skin is dry, but the scales are lying flat. Scaly Leg Mites would cause the scales to lift vertically. The primary issue is the infection on the bottom of the foot. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_05.jpg", "question": "Is the dark spot a foreign object or disease?", "answer": "It is a disease lesion. While it may have started as a puncture wound from a foreign object, it has now formed a chronic necrotic plug characteristic of Bumblefoot. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_05.jpg", "question": "Can this be mistaken for a Spur?", "answer": "No. A Spur is a distinct appendage. This is a lesion integrated into the weight-bearing surface of the foot. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_06.jpg", "question": "Why is the chicken favoring one leg?", "answer": "The visual evidence shows a massive swelling on the footpad, likely causing severe pain and lameness. This is functional impairment due to Bumblefoot. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Marek' </TRIGGER_KB> Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_06.jpg", "question": "Is the swelling due to Gout or Bumblefoot?", "answer": "Gout typically causes swelling in the joints (toes/hocks). This swelling is centered on the soft footpad and features a surface scab, which points to bacterial pododermatitis (Bumblefoot). Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_06.jpg", "question": "Is this Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. Mites affect the shanks/scales. The pathology here is restricted to the plantar cushion. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_07.jpg", "question": "Is this a Healthy foot?", "answer": "No. A healthy foot has smooth skin. This foot has a large, crusty, brown lesion covering the center of the pad. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_07.jpg", "question": "Is this lesion a Spur?", "answer": "No. It is located on the sole of the foot, whereas spurs are located on the shank. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_07.jpg", "question": "Does the crust indicate Mites?", "answer": "No. Mite crusts are chalky/white and diffuse over the leg. This crust is dark, circumscribed, and located over an abscess. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_08.jpg", "question": "What is the severity of this lesion?", "answer": "The lesion shows a large, prominent black plug with significant surrounding swelling, indicating an advanced stage of infection (Grade 3 or 4). Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_08.jpg", "question": "Is this Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "No. The shanks are smooth and shiny. Only the footpad is affected. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_08.jpg", "question": "Is the black mass a tumor?", "answer": "Unlikely. It has the appearance of necrotic tissue (dead skin/scab) covering an abscess, which is standard for Bumblefoot. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_09.jpg", "question": "Is the minor spot on the foot a concern?", "answer": "Yes. Even a small black scab indicates early-stage Bumblefoot (Grade 1 or 2). A healthy foot should have no black spots. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_09.jpg", "question": "Is this Mites?", "answer": "No. No raised scales visible. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_09.jpg", "question": "Is this a Spur?", "answer": "No. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_10.jpg", "question": "Is the swollen toe caused by Mites?", "answer": "No. Mites cause crusty skin, not localized swelling of a single toe/pad. This is likely an infection extending into the toe digits. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_10.jpg", "question": "Is this articular Gout?", "answer": "Possible, as Gout affects joints. However, the presence of a plantar scab strongly suggests bacterial entry and Bumblefoot. <TRIGGER_KB> key='Gout' </TRIGGER_KB> Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
{"img_path": "foot_bumble/images/bumble_10.jpg", "question": "Is this foot Healthy?", "answer": "No. The distortion and scabbing are abnormal. Conclusion: This presentation is consistent with Bumblefoot."}
