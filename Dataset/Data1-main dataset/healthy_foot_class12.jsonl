{"img_path": "foot_healthy/images/healthy_leg_329.jpg", "question": "What visual features rule out the presence of Scaly Leg Mites?", "answer": "The visual features that rule out Scaly Leg Mites are the **smooth, unbroken appearance of the scales** on the **shanks and toes**, and the **absence of any raised, crusty, or thickened areas**, confirming a **Healthy Foot**."}
{"img_path": "foot_healthy/images/healthy_leg_329.jpg", "question": "Are there any visual cues to suggest Bumblefoot?", "answer": "There are **no visual cues** to suggest Bumblefoot, as the **footpads are not clearly visible** to check for a characteristic black lesion or swelling, and the visible parts of the toes and shanks show no related swelling or ulceration, which is consistent with a **Healthy Foot** in the visible areas."}
{"img_path": "foot_healthy/images/healthy_leg_329.jpg", "question": "Can Spur Foot be identified from this image?", "answer": "No, **Spur Foot cannot be identified** because there are **no overgrown spurs** visible on the shanks, and the overall morphology of the limbs appears typical for a healthy chicken, indicating a **Healthy Foot**."}
{"img_path": "foot_healthy/images/healthy_leg_329.jpg", "question": "Describe the color and texture of the visible scales.", "answer": "The visible scales on the **shanks and toes** are predominantly **yellow in color** and have a **smooth, uniform texture**, characteristic of a **Healthy Foot**."}
