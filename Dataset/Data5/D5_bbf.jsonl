  {"img_path": null, "question": "Why is 'Wet Litter' the #1 cause of Bumblefoot?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Wet litter (lót nền ẩm) softens the skin on the bottom of the foot, making it much easier for small cracks to form.

  {"img_path": null, "question": "What is the 'Cheesy Plug' (Nhân ké) made of?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: It is 'Caseous Pus.' Unlike liquid human pus, bird pus is thick and solid like cream cheese. 3.
