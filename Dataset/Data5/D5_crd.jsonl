{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Lung Scarring' and why does it affect meat quality?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Chronic CRD causes the delicate lung tissue to turn into tough scar tissue (fibrosis). 3. Sanitation: These birds cannot process oxygen efficiently, leading to 'Ascites' (water in the belly) and poor muscle development. This makes the bird look 'thin' despite eating well. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is it better to inject Tylosin or put it in the water?", "answer": "1. Medication: For a single, high-value sick bird, **Injection** is better because it provides a precise dose. For a whole flock, **Water** is more practical to reduce stress. 2.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can CRD cause 'Puffy Head' (Sưng đầu) like SHS (Swollen Head Syndrome)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Yes, if E. coli is involved. 2. Supportive: SHS is a virus, but CRD/CCRD causes similar swelling because the sinuses are blocked with pus. 3. Sanitation: Clean the waterers twice a day with Iodine; if the birds dip their swollen faces in the water, they spread the bacteria instantly. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the best way to give 'Bromhexine' for thick phlegm (đờm)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Mix it with the morning water (when birds are thirstiest). 2. Supportive: It takes about 2 hours to start working. You will notice the birds 'khẹc' more for a short time as the mucus thins and they try to cough it out—this is a good sign. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How should I rotate antibiotics to avoid CRD resistance?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use **Tylosin** for one flock, then switch to **Doxycycline** for the next, then **Tiamulin** for the third. 2.

Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do many farmers fail when using 'Amoxicillin' for CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Because Amoxicillin only kills the 'E. coli' complication, not the 'Mycoplasma' itself. 2. Supportive: It makes the bird look better for 2 days, but the 'hen khẹc' returns because the primary cause was never killed. 3. Sanitation: Always pair Amoxicillin with Tylosin for a complete cure. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is a 'Cảm lạnh' (Common Cold) the same as CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: No. 2. Supportive: A cold is usually temporary and caused by a quick chill. CRD is a bacterial infection that will not go away without antibiotics or a major immune boost. 3. Sanitation: A cold often *turns into* CRD if the bird is a carrier of Mycoplasma. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How to use 'Menthol' sprays during the night?", "answer": "1. Medication: No. 2. Supportive: Spray a fine mist of Menthol/Eucalyptus over the birds' heads while they are roosting. It helps them breathe during the coldest part of the night. 3.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is CRD harder to control in 'Free-range' (Gà thả vườn) systems?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use pulse-dosing of Tilmicosin during rainy weeks. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Free-range birds are exposed to wild bird droppings and changing weather (rain/sun). Temperature swings stress the immune system, making it easier for Mycoplasma to take over. Use covered outdoor areas to keep the ground dry. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How do 'Macrolide' antibiotics (like Tylosin) actually kill Mycoplasma?", "answer": "1. Medication: They work by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. 2. Supportive: This prevents the bacteria from making proteins, which stops them from growing and reproducing. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Vaccine Interference' in the context of a CRD outbreak?", "answer": "1. Medication: Delay live respiratory vaccines (ND/IB) if the flock is wheezing. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: If you vaccinate a bird that already has CRD, the bird's body is too busy fighting the Mycoplasma to create proper vaccine antibodies. This leads to both a vaccine failure and a worse CRD flare-up. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use 'Tiamulin' in the drinking water for more than 5 days?", "answer": "1. Medication: Generally, 3-5 days is sufficient. 2. Supportive: Long-term use can be bitter, causing birds to drink less water (dehydration). 3.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How much does CRD increase the 'Feed Conversion Ratio' (FCR)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Studies show CRD can worsen FCR by 10-20%. This means you are paying for 20% more feed just to get the same weight gain because the bird's energy is 'wasted' on inflammation. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How to tell the difference between CRD and 'Aspergillosis' (Fungal) gasping?", "answer": "1. Medication: CRD responds to Tylosin; Aspergillosis does not. 2. Supportive: In Aspergillosis, the bird gasps silently ('Silent Gasping'). In CRD, there is usually a 'rattle' or 'click' (hen khẹc). 3. Sanitation: Aspergillosis comes from moldy straw; CRD comes from other birds/dust. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can CRD spread through 'Feather Dust' (Bụi lông)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Yes.

{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the 'Synergy' between CRD and Infectious Bronchitis (IB)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Treat both with respiratory tonics. 2. Supportive: IB is a virus that destroys the protective lining of the throat. Mycoplasma then uses this 'open door' to enter the lungs. Together, they cause 10x more damage than alone. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I 'drain' a swollen sinus in a rooster with CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use systemic antibiotics (Enrofloxacin) after draining. 2. Supportive: If the face is very swollen, a vet can make a tiny cut to remove the 'cheesy' pus. 3. Sanitation: This pus is full of Mycoplasma; it must be burned or disinfected immediately so it doesn't touch the floor. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Summary: Why is 'Environmental Control' 70% of the CRD cure?", "answer": "1. Medication: Only does 30% of the work. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: **If you don't fix the wet litter and the ammonia smell, the CRD will come back the day you stop giving medicine.** Clean air is the best antibiotic. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is Tilmicosin preferred for high-density broiler houses?", "answer": "1. Medication: Tilmicosin specifically concentrates in the lung tissue and white blood cells (macrophages). 2. Supportive: This 'targeted' approach means it stays active in the lungs for several days even after the birds stop drinking the medicated water. 3. Sanitation: It is highly effective at stopping 'flare-ups' triggered by the high dust and ammonia levels common in crowded houses. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What are the risks of 'Antibiotic Residues' (Tồn dư kháng sinh) in CRD-treated chickens?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: If birds are sold before the withdrawal period (7-14 days), humans who eat the meat ingest small amounts of antibiotics.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use 'Doxycycline' if my water is very 'Hard' (high in Calcium)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not recommended. 2. Supportive: Calcium and Magnesium in hard water bind to Doxycycline, making it impossible for the bird's gut to absorb the medicine. 3. Sanitation: If you have hard water, use a water softener or switch to an antibiotic like Tilmicosin which is less affected by minerals. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'ORT' and how does it look like CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: ORT (Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale) is a bacteria that causes similar 'gasping.' 2. Supportive: ORT is much more aggressive and causes 'sudden death' with blood-tinged mucus. CRD is slower and 'chronic.' 3. Sanitation: ORT requires high doses of Amoxicillin or Florfenicol; standard CRD meds often fail against it. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does 'Litter Acidity' affect Mycoplasma survival?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Mycoplasma prefers a neutral pH. Using acidifying litter amendments (like sodium bisulfate) lowers the pH, making the bedding a hostile environment for the bacteria and reducing ammonia release. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Snotty Beak' (Mũi bẩn) and is it always CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use a 5-day course of Oxytetracycline. 2. Supportive: Feed dust sticks to the wet nasal discharge, creating a dark 'crust' on the beak. 3.

{"img_path": null, "question": "How to manage 'Tunnel Ventilation' to reduce CRD stress?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: High wind speeds (Wind Chill) can stress birds. Ensure the air is moving *above* the birds to remove heat and ammonia, but avoid 'blasting' cold air directly onto them, which triggers CRD. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why is 'Vitamin B12' added to CRD injection mixes?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: B12 stimulates the appetite and helps the liver process the antibiotics. Birds with CRD often stop eating; B12 'wakes them up' so they start consuming nutrients again. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is it true that 'MG-Free' chicks grow 10% faster?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Yes. Because they don't have to spend energy fighting a 'Silent CRD' infection, every gram of protein goes toward muscle and bone growth. 3. Sanitation: Starting with MG-Free (Mycoplasma gallisepticum free) stock is the best investment a farmer can make. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can CRD cause 'Joint Lameness' (Gà đi cà nhắc)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Yes, if it is *Mycoplasma synoviae* (MS). 2.

Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the 'Withdrawal Period' for eggs when using Doxycycline?", "answer": "1. Medication: Usually 7 days. 2. Supportive: In many countries, Doxycycline is actually banned for use in 'Commercial Layers' because residues stay in the yolk for a long time. 3. Sanitation: Use Erythromycin instead if the birds are actively laying eggs for market. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why do 'Backyard' birds (Gà ta) seem more resistant to CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: They grow slower and have lower metabolic stress than industrial broilers. 3. Sanitation: However, they are often 'carriers' who look healthy but will kill industrial chicks if mixed together. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can 'Heat Lamps' cause CRD if placed too low?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Yes. If the lamp is too low, it 'dries out' the air too much. Dry air (humidity below 40%) cracks the bird's throat lining, allowing Mycoplasma to enter. Aim for 60-70% humidity in the brooder. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How to use 'Gentamicin' for CRD complications?", "answer": "1. Medication: Gentamicin is very strong against E. coli (CCRD). 2. Supportive: It is usually given by injection because it is poorly absorbed when given in the water. 3. Sanitation: **Caution:** It is harsh on the kidneys; ensure birds have plenty of fresh water during treatment. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does 'Rice Hull' (Trấu) litter need to be pre-treated for CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Yes. Rice hulls are often dusty. Spray them with a light disinfectant mist before putting birds in the coop to 'kill' any wild bird bacteria and settle the dust. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I mix 'Tylosin' with 'Newcastle Vaccine' in the water?", "answer": "1. Medication: **NO.** 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: The antibiotic will kill the 'live' carrier bacteria in some vaccines or change the pH, making the vaccine useless. Wait 2 days after vaccinating before starting CRD antibiotics. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Air Sac Wash' (Rửa túi khí) in research?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: This is a lab technique used to collect Mycoplasma samples. 3. Sanitation: For a farmer, if you see 'sudsy' or 'soapy' bubbles in the air sacs during necropsy, it means the Mycoplasma is actively destroying the tissue. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Summary: What are the 'Big 3' costs of CRD to a farmer?", "answer": "1. Medication: **1. Medicine cost** (Antibiotics are expensive). 2. Supportive: **2. Lost FCR** (Energy wasted on breathing). 3. Sanitation: **3. Condemnation** (Birds being rejected at the market because of 'scarred' lungs). <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is the 'All-In/All-Out' strategy for CRD eradication?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: This means never mixing different ages of birds on one farm. When the flock is sold, the entire farm is emptied, cleaned, and disinfected. Since Mycoplasma dies without a host, this 'breaks the chain' and ensures the next flock starts in a 100% CRD-free environment. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Why must I clean the 'Fan Blades' and 'Rafters' to stop CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Dust is the #1 carrier of Mycoplasma. If you clean the floor but leave dust on the ceiling fans and rafters, the wind will blow that old infected dust back onto your new chicks the moment you turn on the ventilation. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does 'Egg Dipping' work for CRD prevention?", "answer": "1. Medication: Hatching eggs are warmed and then dipped into a cold antibiotic solution (like Tylosin). 2. Supportive: The temperature difference creates a vacuum that pulls the medicine through the shell pores and into the egg. 3. Sanitation: This kills any Mycoplasma inside the egg before the chick begins to develop. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can CRD cause 'Sudden Death' without wheezing?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use Florfenicol for 'Acute' cases. 2. Supportive: No, CRD is usually slow. If birds are dying suddenly with purple combs, suspect 'Acute CCRD' (with E. coli Septicemia) or Avian Influenza/Pasteurellosis. 3. Sanitation: Sudden death requires immediate isolation and a necropsy. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Does 'Winter Brooding' (Úm gà mùa đông) increase CRD risk?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use preventative Tylosin for the first 3 days. 2. Supportive: Yes. Farmers often close all windows to keep chicks warm, which traps ammonia and moisture. 3. Sanitation: You must balance 'Warmth' with 'Fresh Air.' Even in winter, there must be a small gap at the top of the house to let gases escape. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Is it effective to use 'Tylvalosin' and 'Chlortetracycline' together?", "answer": "1. Medication: Yes, this is a 'Power Mix' used for severe, resistant CRD outbreaks in industrial farms. 2. Supportive: Always consult a vet for the exact ratio to avoid kidney stress. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How does CRD affect 'Breeder Roosters' (Gà trống giống)?", "answer": "1. Medication: Treat with Tiamulin. 2. Supportive: Chronic CRD reduces the rooster's stamina and 'libido' (mating drive). 3. Sanitation: High fever from respiratory infection can temporarily kill sperm, leading to 'Clear Eggs' (unfertilized) in the hatchery 2 weeks later. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use 'Quicklime' (Vôi bột) inside the coop with birds present?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: **Be careful.** While lime kills bacteria and absorbs ammonia, the dust from the lime can irritate the birds' lungs and make 'hen khẹc' worse. Only apply it to wet spots and cover it with fresh litter immediately. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Mist Disinfection' during a CRD outbreak?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use a safe disinfectant like Virkon S. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Spraying a very fine mist (fog) of disinfectant over the birds' heads 2-3 times a week kills the Mycoplasma floating on dust particles before other birds can breathe it in. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "How can I tell if 'Mild Avian Influenza' is masquerading as CRD?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: If you treat with Tylosin/Doxy for 5 days and the birds get *worse* instead of better, it is likely a virus (H9N2 or IB). 3. Sanitation: Send a sample for PCR testing to confirm if it is bacterial (CRD) or viral. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "What is 'Pulse Therapy' for CRD management?", "answer": "1. Medication: Giving a full dose of antibiotics for only 2-3 days every month. 2. Supportive: This 'pulse' keeps the bacterial levels too low to cause an outbreak without having to medicate every day. 3. Sanitation: Not applicable. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"crd_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "Can Mycoplasma survive in 'Nipple Drinkers'?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Yes, if there is a 'Biofilm' (slime) inside the pipes.
