Sanitation: Ensure the dust bath area is clean and dry to allow natural feather maintenance. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "Is there a specific protocol for Coccidiosis in 'Silkie' chickens?", "answer": "1. Medication: Silkies are sensitive; use Amprolium at a slightly lower concentration but for a full 7 days. 2. Supportive: Since their feathers don't insulate well, keep them extra warm (above 25°C) during the illness. 3. Sanitation: Silkies often have 'puffy' head feathers; ensure they don't drag these in wet, infected litter. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "My birds are on a 'Natural' program. What is the best organic prevention?", "answer": "1. Medication: Use Oregano oil and Yucca extract in the water (proven to reduce oocyst shedding). 2. Supportive: Feed fermented grain (high in lactic acid) to create a gut environment that inhibits parasites. 3. Sanitation: Use the 'Deep Bedding' method with beneficial microbes to break down the oocysts naturally. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "How long do Eimeria oocysts survive in an empty coop?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: They can live for up to 1 year in moist soil. You must use high heat or an ammonia-based disinfectant before re-stocking. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "What is the care plan for a bird with 'Cloacitis' (sore vent) following Cocci diarrhea?", "answer": "1. Medication: Finish the Amprolium course. 2. Supportive: Apply a thin layer of Vaseline or antibiotic ointment to the vent skin to prevent cracking and 'pick-out' from other birds. 3. Sanitation: Ensure the floor is covered in soft, dry wood shavings to prevent the sore vent from touching hard manure. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "The birds are 'Star-Gazing' (Polyneuritis) after treatment. Is it a relapse?", "answer": "1. Medication: No, this is Vitamin B1 deficiency caused by Amprolium. Stop the drug immediately. 2. Supportive: Inject 0.5ml of Vitamin B-Complex or give high-dose Thiamine orally. 3. Sanitation: Ensure the birds are in a safe, small space so they don't hurt themselves while disoriented. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"coccidiosis_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "Can I use 'Dettol' or 'Bleach' to clean the waterers during an outbreak?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3.
