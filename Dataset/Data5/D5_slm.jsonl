  {"img_path": null, "question": "Can I put 'Permethrin' powder in the birds' dust bath?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: Not applicable. 3. Sanitation: Yes. This is a great preventative measure. As the birds dust themselves, the powder gets onto their legs and helps kill any mites before they can tunnel under the scales. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"scaly_leg_mites_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "Why do mites prefer the legs and not the body feathers?", "answer": "1. Medication: Not applicable. 2. Supportive: *Knemidocoptes mutans* is specifically adapted to live in the skin *under* scales. 3. Sanitation: Body feathers are too thin and exposed for them; they need the 'armor' of the scales to protect their colony and their eggs. <TRIGGER_KB> key=\"scaly_leg_mites_treatment_protocol\" </TRIGGER_KB>"}
  {"img_path": null, "question": "How to use 'Epsom Salt' to help with Scaly Leg?", "answer": "1. Medication: No. 2.
