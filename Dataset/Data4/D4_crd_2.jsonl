{"img_path": null, "question": "My chicken's face looks slightly swollen all over, and her comb and wattles are a uniform dark purple. Her eyes are half-closed.", "answer": "The description of general, slight facial swelling and uniform dark purple comb and wattles, with half-closed eyes, points to shared facial characteristics that are not exclusive to a single knowledge base. Text-only descriptions are insufficient for a confident assessment. Sharing images or further details about the chicken's head could be very helpful. <TRIGGER_KB key='Chronic'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Avian Influenza'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My hen has some mild facial puffiness around her eyes, and her comb is a very dull, almost greyish white. She seems a bit listless.", "answer": "Observations of mild facial puffiness around the eyes and a very dull, almost greyish white comb, suggest overlapping head involvement patterns. These visible head characteristics are not distinct enough for routing to a single knowledge base based on a text description alone. Providing photos or more details about the chicken's head would be beneficial. <TRIGGER_KB key='Chronic'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Newcastle'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "I'm seeing a few small, dry, dark brown scabs on my chicken's comb. Her facial skin looks generally a bit flaky and dry.", "answer": "The presence of a few small, dry, dark brown scabs on the comb, along with generally flaky and dry facial skin, describes visible head characteristics that can be ambiguous. Such skin surface changes can be consistent with overlapping patterns. Text-only descriptions are often insufficient to distinguish between these possibilities. Sharing images or additional observations of the chicken's head is encouraged. <TRIGGER_KB key='Chronic'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Fowlpox'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My chicken's comb and wattles are a bit less vivid than they usually are, but her face looks otherwise healthy. It's a subtle, intermittent paleness.", "answer": "The description of comb and wattles that are a bit less vivid than usual, but with an otherwise healthy-looking face, and a subtle, intermittent paleness, points to a nuanced scenario. These visible head characteristics are not indicative of clear abnormality but show subtle, inconsistent variations. Text-only descriptions can be insufficient for a precise assessment. Further observations or images of the chicken's head could provide more clarity. <TRIGGER_KB key='Chronic'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Healthy'/>"}
