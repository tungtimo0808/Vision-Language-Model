{"img_path": null, "question": "I noticed some very fine crusting on a few scales on my chicken's lower leg, and a tiny, almost invisible, dry spot on the footpad.", "answer": "Text-only descriptions of very fine crusting on leg scales and a tiny, dry footpad spot present overlapping visible characteristics. It's not possible to route confidently to a single knowledge base from a description like this. Providing images or more observations of the chicken's legs and feet might help distinguish between different patterns. <TRIGGER_KB key='Bumblefoot'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Scaly leg mites'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My rooster has a slightly discolored area on his footpad and the spur on that leg seems to have a minor, uneven texture on its surface.", "answer": "When observing visible leg and foot characteristics, a slightly discolored footpad area and a minor, uneven spur texture can relate to multiple conditions. A text-only description is insufficient for routing to a single, specific knowledge base. Sharing images or further observations about the chicken's legs and feet would be beneficial. <TRIGGER_KB key='Bumblefoot'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Spur'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "There's a minuscule dot on my chicken's footpad, almost like a very tiny bruise, but it's not purple or blue, just a little darker.", "answer": "A text-only description of a minuscule dark dot on a footpad may not provide enough distinct visible information for a single routing. Such a minor surface feature could potentially relate to various foot conditions or natural variations. Sharing images or providing further details about the chicken’s legs and feet could offer more clarity. <TRIGGER_KB key='Bumblefoot'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Healthy'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My chicken's footpad has a small area that feels slightly thicker than the rest, and also the scales on its lower leg appear somewhat dull and not tightly aligned.", "answer": "Descriptions of a slightly thicker footpad area and dull, not tightly aligned leg scales can present overlapping leg skin characteristics. Relying solely on a text description makes it challenging to route to a single knowledge base. Sharing images or providing additional details of the chicken's legs and feet could offer more clarity. <TRIGGER_KB key='Bumblefoot'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Scaly leg mites'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "I see a hard, somewhat irregular lump on my rooster's footpad near the back, and the spur on that leg also has a slightly gnarled appearance.", "answer": "Text-only descriptions of a hard, irregular footpad lump and a slightly gnarled spur present overlapping visible characteristics. It's not possible to route confidently to a single knowledge base from a description like this. Providing images or more observations of the chicken's legs and feet might help distinguish between different patterns. <TRIGGER_KB key='Bumblefoot'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Spur'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "One of my chicken's footpads looks a little bit paler in a small spot, almost like a faded area, but it's not rough or anything.", "answer": "A text-only description of a slightly paler or faded spot on a footpad can be insufficient for a specific reference. The observed color variation might share characteristics with different foot-related patterns.
