Providing images or more detailed observations of the chicken’s head would aid in refining the reference. <TRIGGER_KB key='Avian Influenza'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Newcastle'/>"}
{"img_path":null,"question":"My chicken has a few small, crusty bumps on her earlobes and some mild facial swelling. Her comb also has a few rough patches.","answer":"Text-only descriptions offer limited information for precise routing. The presence of small, crusty bumps on the earlobes, mild facial swelling, and rough patches on the comb describes visible head characteristics that can be observed across overlapping head involvement patterns. Sharing images or additional specific observations of the chicken’s head would be beneficial. <TRIGGER_KB key='Avian Influenza'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Fowlpox'/>"}
{"img_path":null,"question":"My hen's comb seems a little less bright red today, and there's a very, very faint puffiness on her right lower eyelid. I'm almost not sure if it's there.","answer":"Text-only descriptions provide limited information for precise routing. The very subtle change in comb brightness and the extremely faint puffiness on a lower eyelid describe visible head characteristics that can fall within a range from individual variation to very early or mild patterns of head involvement. Providing images or further observations of the chicken’s head could help clarify these subtle appearances. <TRIGGER_KB key='Avian Influenza'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Healthy'/>"}
