Remember that a text description provides only a limited view of the situation. Symptoms such as depression, coughing (respiratory signs), and involuntary muscle spasms (neurological signs) indicate a significant pattern involving general, respiratory, and neurological functions.

A comprehensive understanding isn't possible from text alone. A combination of symptoms such as a complete cessation of egg production, head tremors (neurological signs), and bright green, watery diarrhea, suggests a specific pattern.

The combination of severe respiratory distress (open-mouth breathing, gasping) and profound neurological signs such as corkscrew neck twists and complete loss of balance, indicates a strong pattern that should prompt consultation of disease knowledge bases.
