{"img_path": null, "question": "There's a lot of loose, yellowish droppings, and some contain small, sticky, reddish-orange bits.", "answer": "Descriptions of loose, yellowish droppings containing small, sticky, reddish-orange bits suggest intestinal patterns with shared characteristics. The combination of loose consistency, yellowish color, and reddish-orange bits shows overlapping features in droppings. Text-only descriptions are insufficient for a complete understanding. Providing pictures or more details about the droppings could help clarify observations.\n<TRIGGER_KB key='Salmonella'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Coccidiosis'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "My chickens are making entirely liquid droppings, some are bright green, others are very watery and almost white.", "answer": "When chickens are making entirely liquid droppings, with some being bright green and others very watery and almost white, it indicates overlapping characteristics in intestinal patterns. The variation in color despite uniform liquid consistency suggests shared features across different digestive states. Text-only descriptions are not enough for a thorough assessment. Visual information or further observations would be helpful.\n<TRIGGER_KB key='Salmonella'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Newcastle'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "The flock's droppings are mostly normal, but I'm seeing a few that are very watery and an unusual, faint yellow color.", "answer": "Observing that the flock's droppings are mostly normal, but some are very watery and an unusual, faint yellow color, indicates overlapping characteristics in digestive output. The presence of both typical consistency and distinctively watery, discolored droppings means a single reference point is not sufficient. Text-only descriptions are not enough for a thorough assessment. Sharing images or additional observations of the droppings could be beneficial.\n<TRIGGER_KB key='Salmonella'/><TRIGGER_KB key='Healthy'/>"}
{"img_path": null, "question": "The poop is very watery, brownish, and has some reddish-orange film or mucus.", "answer": "Descriptions of very watery, brownish droppings with some reddish-orange film or mucus suggest intestinal patterns with shared characteristics. The combination of liquid consistency, brownish color, and reddish-orange film/mucus shows overlapping features in droppings. Text-only descriptions are insufficient for a complete understanding.

{"img_path": null, "question": "I'm seeing thin, liquid droppings, some are a pale greenish-yellow, others are just clear and watery.", "answer": "When there are thin, liquid droppings, with some being pale greenish-yellow and others just clear and watery, it points to overlapping characteristics in intestinal patterns. The variation in color despite uniform liquid consistency suggests shared features across different digestive states. Text-only descriptions are not enough for a thorough assessment.

{"img_path": null, "question": "Some droppings have the usual solid and white parts, but others are just a watery puddle of pale yellow.", "answer": "When some droppings have typical solid and white parts, while others are just a watery puddle of pale yellow, it suggests overlapping characteristics in digestive output. The presence of both normal and entirely liquid, discolored droppings means a single reference point is not sufficient. Text-only descriptions are not enough for a thorough assessment.
