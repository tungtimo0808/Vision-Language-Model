The underlying cause of the scale deformation is the burrowing activity of the Scaly Leg Mite (Knemidocoptes mutans). These microscopic mites tunnel into the epidermal layers beneath the scales, causing intense irritation, inflammation, and serum exudation. This reaction leads to hyperkeratosis, where new skin cells are produced excessively and old ones are not shed properly, resulting in the characteristic lifting, thickening, and distortion of the leg scales.","The primary biological system most affected is the **dermal system**, specifically the epideral cells responsible for keratin production.

Test/image_test/test_spur_2.jpg,Why do these mites specifically target the leg scales and not other feathered parts of the chicken? What does the crusting indicate pathologically?,"Scaly Leg Mites (Knemidocoptes mutans) prefer the non-feathered, keratinized skin of the legs and feet because it provides an ideal environment for burrowing and feeding on the epidermal cells. The extensive crusting you observe is a result of the mites tunneling under the scales, causing irritation, inflammation, and serum exudation which dries and accumulates with dead skin cells, leading to hyperkeratosis and lifting of the scales. The integumentary system is primarily affected.","Mites specifically target the leg scales because they are keratinized and provide a suitable environment for burrowing.
