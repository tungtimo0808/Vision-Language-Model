    "query": "How can Newcastle disease virus infect the digestive system and still be shed by birds that look clinically healthy?",
    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_gastrointestinal_virus_shedding"
    ],
    "answer": "NDV can infect the gastrointestinal tract and be actively shed in feces; cloacal detection reflects intestinal replication and persistence, so birds may shed even when clinically healthy or after mild infection."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_intestinal_reservoir_carrier_state"
    ],
    "answer": "Because the intestinal tract can act as a reservoir, allowing a carrier state where birds without overt signs continue to excrete NDV in feces and sustain silent transmission."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_fecal_contamination_environment"
    ],
    "answer": "NDV-positive feces can contaminate manure and soil and be carried on footwear or vehicle tires, enabling indirect spread from contaminated environments to susceptible birds."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_digestive_route_transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "A major pathway is fecal–oral transmission: birds ingest feed or water contaminated with NDV-infected feces, leading to intestinal exposure and subsequent replication and shedding."

    "qid": "ncd_p_05",
    "query": "Why can fecal samples be difficult matrices for molecular detection of NDV even though feces are a major excretion route?",
    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_gastrointestinal_fecal_shedding_detection"
    ],
    "answer": "Feces are a major NDV excretion route, but they are complex matrices containing inhibitory substances, bacteria, and toxic compounds that can interfere with conventional molecular detection."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_feces_interference_molecular_detection"
    ],
    "answer": "Organic substances, microbial contaminants, and toxic compounds can inhibit reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase, reducing RT-PCR sensitivity and causing false-negative or inconsistent results."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_rbc_rt_pcr_fecal_samples"
    ],
    "answer": "It uses NDV’s ability to bind chicken red blood cells to concentrate and purify viral particles from feces before RNA extraction, improving sensitivity compared with conventional RT-PCR."

    "qid": "ncd_p_08",
    "query": "How sensitive was RBC adsorption–coupled RT-PCR for detecting NDV in diluted fecal samples?",
    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_fecal_detection_sensitivity"
    ],
    "answer": "NDV RNA could be detected in feces diluted up to 10^4-fold, indicating high sensitivity even when fecal viral load is low."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_cloacal_vs_oral_shedding_dynamics"
    ],
    "answer": "Cloacal shedding may be limited early after infection, but at later stages viral RNA is more consistently detected in fecal samples, indicating gastrointestinal shedding intensifies as infection progresses."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "newcastle_gastrointestinal_role_mixed_species",
      "newcastle_digestive_route_transmission"
    ],
    "answer": "Different poultry species can shed NDV through the gastrointestinal tract, and when species are housed together their feces contaminate shared environments. This cross-species fecal exposure amplifies digestive-route transmission among chickens."

      "newcastle_gastrointestinal_virus_shedding",
      "newcastle_fecal_shedding_surveillance_value"
    ],
    "answer": "Because NDV can persist and be shed from the gastrointestinal tract even without obvious disease, monitoring cloacal and fecal samples enables early identification of infected flocks and assessment of ongoing intestinal shedding for surveillance purposes."

    ],
    "answer": "Enteric NDV pathotypes all target the gastrointestinal tract, but viscerotropic velogenic strains cause severe hemorrhagic intestinal lesions, whereas subclinical enteric strains may produce localized intestinal infection with minimal or no respiratory or neurological signs."
