    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "bumblefoot_transmission_pathogenesis"

    "answer": "The footpad takes most of the bird’s weight, so repeated pressure and small cracks make it the most vulnerable entry point for infection."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "bumblefoot_symptom_clinical_signs"

    "answer": "The dark scab forms over infected tissue as the body walls off infection beneath the footpad."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "answer": "The infection forms a firm, caseous core surrounded by fibrous tissue that blocks drainage and limits antibiotic penetration."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "bumblefoot_transmission_pathogenesis",
      "bumblefoot_symptom_clinical_signs"
    ],
    "answer": "Repeated pressure damages the footpad, allowing infection to develop under the skin. This leads to swelling, pain, and formation of the dark scab that causes lameness."
