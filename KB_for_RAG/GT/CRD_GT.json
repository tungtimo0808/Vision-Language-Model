    "supporting_chunk_ids": ["crd_overview_01_definition_and_importance"],
    "answer": "CRD is a long-lasting respiratory disease mainly caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Birds can carry the organism for a long time and keep spreading it within the flock."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": ["crd_overview_01_definition_and_importance"],
    "answer": "Many infected birds become carriers and shed the bacteria intermittently, allowing CRD to persist even when clinical signs are mild."

    "answer": "CRD spreads slowly through close contact and respiratory secretions, especially when birds are housed closely together."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": ["crd_symptom_02_systemic_and_production_effects"],
