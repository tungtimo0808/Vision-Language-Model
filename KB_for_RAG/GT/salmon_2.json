    "supporting_chunk_ids": [

    "answer": "Antimicrobial treatment rarely eliminates Salmonella, may promote antimicrobial resistance, and treated birds often continue to shed the organism in feces."

      "salmonella_typhimurium_oral_infection",
      "salmonella_typhimurium_egg_contamination"

    "answer": "Oral infection frequently results in intestinal colonization and fecal shedding, but reproductive tract invasion and egg contamination are inconsistent, indicating that gastrointestinal infection alone does not reliably lead to internal egg contamination."

      "salmonella_typhimurium_oral_infection"

    "answer": "Alternative routes such as aerosol or vaginal exposure bypass some gastrointestinal barriers, facilitating systemic infection and increasing the likelihood of internal egg contamination compared with oral exposure."

      "salmonella_overview_food_safety"
    ],
    "answer": "Infected birds shed Salmonella in feces, contaminating litter, feed, and water, which facilitates fecal–oral transmission and rapid horizontal spread, especially under poor hygiene conditions."

      "salmonella_paratyphoid_diarrhea",
      "salmonella_diagnosis_bacteriology"

    "answer": "Clinical signs are variable and overlap with other gastrointestinal diseases, so definitive diagnosis requires bacteriologic isolation rather than relying on fecal appearance or general symptoms alone."

    "answer": "Host-adapted serotypes are commonly transmitted vertically through eggs, while non–host-adapted paratyphoid serotypes primarily spread horizontally via fecal–oral transmission and environmental contamination."

    "supporting_chunk_ids": [
      "salmonella_vaccine_efficacy_shedding",
      "salmonella_prevention_biosecurity"
    ],
    "answer": "Vaccination reduces intestinal colonization and fecal shedding, while biosecurity limits pathogen introduction and spread; together they provide more effective control than either approach alone."
