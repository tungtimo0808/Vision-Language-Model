It is recognised internationally as a transboundary animal disease and classified as an emergency animal disease in Australia. Clinically, virulent Newcastle disease is characterised by systemic infection involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems, with variable disease expression depending on viral strain virulence, host species and age, immune status, and environmental conditions, necessitating laboratory confirmation for definitive diagnosis due to its resemblance to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).",
