    "content": "Avian influenza (AI), caused by influenza A viruses, is an infectious disease of poultry and wild birds, defined by clinical signs, biological characteristics, and population-level impact. The virus is divided into low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) based on pathogenicity in poultry. LPAI infections often cause mild disease or no visible signs, limited to respiratory signs or reduced egg production, allowing silent circulation within flocks. In contrast, HPAI infections cause acute systemic disease, rapid spread, and high mortality, sometimes leading to entire flock loss. Due to its economic and regulatory importance, HPAI is a notifiable disease in many countries, requiring immediate reporting and coordinated response by veterinary authorities, highlighting avian influenza as a high-impact disease managed at the flock and industry level.",

Influenza A viruses, including HPAI and LPAI subtypes like H5N1, circulate naturally in wild birds, creating pressure for virus introduction into domestic poultry.

Avian influenza is managed through surveillance, early detection, movement control, and biosecurity, with veterinary authorities confirming and responding to outbreaks, and farmers and veterinarians contributing through observation and compliance with control measures, reflecting a population-based approach to managing the disease, which also involves understanding transmission pathways, diagnosis using methods like rRT-PCR, and prevention strategies to protect against viruses like NDV and Mycoplasma, and monitoring specific clades such as clade 2.3.4.4b.",

The EU Joint Research Centre notes that influenza viruses, including HPAI and LPAI subtypes like H5N1, are surveillance targets under the revised Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. Wastewater monitoring is being explored as a population-level indicator, complementing targeted sampling in high-risk animals, such as those infected with NDV or Mycoplasma. Environmental surveillance can highlight geographic hotspots, informing intensified sampling, biosecurity audits, or movement controls, and can be used in conjunction with diagnostic tools like rRT-PCR to detect specific strains, including clade 2.3.4.4b. This approach supports real-time risk scoring, integrating lab results, wildlife detections, and environmental indicators, and can be used to inform decision-making, even in the absence of clear clinical signs, ultimately enhancing disease control and prevention efforts.",

    "content": "The host range of viruses, such as HPAI and LPAI, particularly subtypes like H5N1, is shaped by biological constraints that must be overcome for efficient replication in different animals. Repeated mammalian infections, including those caused by clade 2.3.4.4b, provide selection pressure that may favor variants replicating better in mammal tissues, as detected by rRT-PCR. As the virus circulates in more mammals, it has more opportunities to find genetic combinations fitting mammalian biology, which is a concern for other diseases like NDV and Mycoplasma. The University of Maryland report on cat infections illustrates host expansion, with transmissions diversifying across domestic and wild feline species. Veterinary authorities treat mammal spillover as a risk multiplier, affecting farm worker safety, animal welfare in companion species, and cross-sector surveillance workload, which is why \"non-bird\" cases, including those in mammals, appear in official updates and influence control policies in poultry.",
