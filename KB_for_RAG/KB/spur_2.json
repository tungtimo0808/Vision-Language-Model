    "content": "Chicken spurs are pointed, conical projections located near the tarsometatarsus on both sides of the lower leg (shank), typically developing prominently in sexually mature roosters. Anatomically, the spur consists of a bony core (calcar) that protrudes from the tarsometatarsal bone and is covered by a keratinized (horny) sheath. Spurs are a sexually dimorphic trait: they are common and usually larger in males, while they may occur in some adult hens but are less common and often smaller. Functionally, spurs serve as weapons during intrasexual competition and for flock defense, but in domestic settings they can also become a welfare and safety risk due to injury potential to birds, handlers, and other animals.",

Spur expression is strongly sex-influenced (male-biased), but sporadic spur development in hens can occur, particularly as hens age, and is generally considered an atypical but recognized phenomenon in domestic flocks. Practical observation in poultry medicine emphasizes that spurs continuously grow (similar to nails), meaning overgrowth and sharpness can increase over time without intervention.",
