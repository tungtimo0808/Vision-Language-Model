Virulent Newcastle disease is recognised internationally as a transboundary animal disease and, in Australia, is classified as an emergency animal disease requiring immediate notification and official response.\n\nClinically, virulent Newcastle disease is characterised by systemic infection with prominent involvement of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Disease expression varies depending on viral strain virulence, host species and age, immune status, and environmental conditions. Outbreaks may be peracute with sudden death, or may progress rapidly with mixed respiratory, neurological, and digestive signs.
