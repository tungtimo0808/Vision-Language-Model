The disease is ubiquitous in commercial poultry production systems worldwide and is widely recognized as one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting broiler chickens. Coccidiosis primarily compromises intestinal integrity, leading to impaired nutrient absorption, reduced growth performance, poor feed conversion efficiency, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. Although infections may be subclinical, their cumulative impact on productivity and flock uniformity remains substantial, making effective control strategies essential for sustainable poultry production.",

Infection leads to intestinal tissue destruction, hemorrhage, impaired nutrient absorption, reduced growth performance, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections such as necrotic enteritis and Salmonella spp. Globally, the prevalence of coccidiosis in poultry ranges widely from 7% to 98%, depending on geography, farming practices, and biosecurity levels. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, where deep-litter systems and high stocking density facilitate continuous oocyst recycling. Economically, coccidiosis represents one of the most costly poultry diseases, accounting for approximately 30% of total pharmacological expenditure in poultry production, with global annual losses estimated to exceed 14 billion USD.",
